                            <h5>The Scope and Substance of the ensuing SECTIONS</h5>
                            <p><a class="capital">P</a>Ererius, a wandring Prince, after
                                many traverses of Fortune, and
                                Tempests in his long Pererrations at Sea, arriv'd at a strange
                                Northwest Iland, where ther reign'd a Queen call'd
                                Morphandra, descended of the High-born Circe, daughter of
                                Sol, who (according to the Etymology of her name) had power to
                                transmute and metamorphose Men to Beasts; Pererius having
                                obtain'd leave of her to see and speak with divers of them, viz, an
                                Otter, an Asse, an Ape, a Hinde, a
                                Mule, a Fox, a Boar, a Wolf, a
                                Goat, a Soland-Goose, a Hive of Bees, &amp;.
                                Morphandra infusing the Faculty both of Reson and
                                Ratiocination into Them during that intervall of time; As also full
                                and full and free election to resume the shapes of Men, and so return
                                unto their own Countries and Callings:
                                attempted to perswade them therunto, but in regard of the rebellious Humors, the
                                horrid Sacriledges, the new-fangled Opinions, and gingling Extravagances that
                                Human brains are subject unto, specially this last doting and
                                vertiginous Age of the World, with the nomberles Indispositions
                                wherunto the Bodies of Men as well as their
                                Brains are expos'd, They did choose rather to continu still in the
                                state and species of Brute Animals, than become Rational
                                Cretures again: At last Prince Pererius mingling speech with a Hive
                                of Bees, who had bin formerly a Monastery of Nuns, He
                                prevail'd so far by his melting perswasions, and high discours of the
                                prerogatives and excellencies of the Human Soul, that He induc'd Them
                                to take on their first Natures again, and so return to their Cloysters;
                                These Discourses are divided into eleven Sections, every
                                Section carrying with it a new Fancy and Matter. Touching the Etymologies of the feigned
                                Words throughout the whole
                                Work, appropriated to the quality of every Country, Climat, and
                                Peeple, the Roots of them must be fetched from the Greek
                                Toung.</p>

                            <p>MADAME, <br> <a class="capital">T</a>His Fancy
                                bearing in the Front
                                the name of a Rare Female, I thought it might well stand with the rules
                                of Congruity to make the Dedication correspond with the
                                Title; And after many revolutions of Thoughts who shold be
                                most proper for my designe, the contemplation of your Honor did cast
                                such strong influences upon Them, that at last They fixed
                                there; Nor will any Discerning Reder question my judgment herein, your
                                Ladiship being so able and fit (as I have the honour to know by
                                experience) to receive this Admired Queen, and give her a suitable
                                entertainment; Therfore, Madame, if you please to admit
                                Morphandra into your Closet, I believe she will afford you severall
                                sorts of divertisements, And she haply may work somtimes a
                                Metamorphosis in your Self, for she can transmute
                                Passions as well as Persons, she can turn
                                Melancholy to Mirth, and Pensivenes to
                                Plesure; For as it is in the French (of which Language you
                                are so great a Mistresse) Les Morts
                                font revivre les Vivants, The Dead enliven the Living,
                                wherby is meant; that Books, though the Authors therof be dead and rotten many Ages
                                before, can beget new spirits in
                                the living Reder. Now, such is the state of Mankind, that the foresaid Passions
                                will have their interchangable turns, they will follow one another as duly as
                                Night succeeds Day in any Human Creture, be the Humors therof
                                never so equally poiz'd; It is denied to Man to be always at Home
                                within himself, and it will be so to the world's end as long as He is compos'd
                                of the four Elements, and as long as the Naturall humors within

                                and motion among themselfs for mastery, which made one break out into this
                                excesse of speech, that if the four Humors were ballanc'd aright in the
                                human body, he wold live easily many thousands of years upon earth;
                                Now, that person may be said to be the wisest among mortalls who can rule and
                                controul those Humors, It being a Principle among the Philosophers, That as the
                                conduct of the Passions (which arise from the
                                Humors ) is the greatest prudence, so the
                                conquest of them is the gretest prowesse, when they grow
                                rebellious: The ensuing Work hath divers glances upon this subject, and variety
                                of things besides, for every Section affords a new Fancy and
                                Matter. It remains now, Madame, that I shold humbly desire, your Honor would please to
                                interpret this Dedicatory Addresse as a small argument of my

                            <h5>To the Severer Sort OF <a class="sic">REDERS</a></h5>
                            <p><a class="capital">S</a>Om of the Antient Sages, who were rank'd among the
                                Philosophers
                                of the Upper House, had a Speculation, That the World
                                was but one huge Animal or Living Creture, compos'd of innumerable
                                members and parts, som Homogeneous or similar, others
                                Heterogeneous or dissimilar; And in order to that they
                                held, That God Almighty was the Great Soul which did inform and actuat
                                the whole Bulk with motion and life, with vertu and vigor, for every
                                part to perform its peculiar function towards the preservation of the
                                Whole: According to this Doctrin an Argument may be drawn by way of
                                Induction, That if the parts begin to impair, the Whole
                                must be in a declining condition; It hath been a Truth which hath pass'd from
                                all times without controul, that Mankind is one of the prime
                                parts of the Universe and Paramount of the
                                Sublunary World, which is demonstrable by that Dominion
                                which was given him over all his fellow-Cretures in Aire, Water, or
                                Earth; He can make the towring Eagle stoop to his Lure
                                from the middle Region; He can make the vast Leviathan, though a
                                hundred times bigger than himself, to flounce from the deep to do him homage on
                                the Shore; He can make the Elephant, though forty times stronger than
                                himself, to draw up his Ships on the Carine<
                                     class="footnote"></span>, and do other
                                drudgeries;
                                This appears also out of that Awe, which by a kind of naturall instinct
                                all other Animals use to shew Him; Insomuch that tryall hath
                                been made, how if a Man should go naked and with a confidence through
                                the Arabian Desarts, where the gretest concours of wild Beasts useth to
                                be, ther's none will assault him, but in a gazing and awfull kind of posture
                                they will keep their distance: Now, if Man, who is so considerable a
                                part of the world, doth decay in his Species, 'tis a
                                shrewd symptom that the Whole is en decadence,
                                in a declining state; Now, that Man doth impair as well in his
                                Intellectualls and the Faculties of his Soul, as in the motions and
                                affections of his heart, this present Age can afford more pregnant proofs than
                                most of the Ages before; For touching the First, What fond futilous new
                                Opinions have bin hatch'd of late times, both in
                                Divinity and in the Idaeas of holy things, as well as in all other
                                Sciences, specially in the Art of Policy, wherin such poor
                                Sciolists<span class="footnote">a hapax legomenon, or unique word</span> are crept up,
                                that wold turn antient
                                Monarchies into new popular Commonwealths, and so set a
                                Hydra's head upon an old Lion's neck, or make a Child's
                                shoo to fit a Giant's foot. Touching the motions of the Heart, ther's nothing of that
                                love and offices of
                                Humanity which were used to be, not onely among private persons and
                                neighbours, but that Allegiance and Love which Subjects were
                                us'd to shew towards their lawfull Prince decaies more and more, whereof ther
                                have been strange examples of late years; In Aethiopia, a large antient
                                Empire, the common peeple did rise up with a petty Companion against their
                                Soveraign, and kill'd him with his two Sons in open field; In
                                Constantinople, two Gran Signors were thrust out of the
                                world by their own Slaves, yet they went not to that heighth of Impudence as to
                                arraign Them before a Barr of Iustice; The Swed hath quite
                                revolted from the Pole, the Portugues from the
                                Spaniard, and so Naples wold have done; What a huge Army
                                did the Basha of Aleppo raise lately? And in the Kingdom of
                                Morocco a mean Fellow, under the seeming shew of Sanctity, what a
                                crew of riff-raff stuff did he drag after him against his lawfull King? But
                                touching these NorthwestS Ilands, they have out-gon all the rest: These
                                metamorphos'd Animals do point at all these, and other degenerations of the
                                Human Creture: Nor is it the first time that Beasts did speak, for
                                we read of one in the Sacred
                                Code who spoke<span class="footnote">Baalam's Ass, c.f. Bible</span>; and besides, sends
                                in to som of
                                Them for Instruction: was one of
                                the first who taught them their Abcee, then , , and others
                                taught Them Their Primer, and the two ingenious Florentines,
                                and may be said to have taught
                                Them their Grammer: But these transmuted Beasts
                                speak in a louder Dialect, who having tryed both Natures, they tell the
                                Human Creture his own, and how he growes daily from bad to worse,
                                according to the Aetas Parentum, pejor avis, tulitNos nequiores, mox daturosProgeniem

                                succumbent and passive to her desires, but actually subservient and pliable
                                to her Transmutations and Changes.</span><span class="speech-act"><span
                                    class="speaker">Morphandra.</span> Prince Pererius (for so I understand your quality
                                and appellation
                                to be); Touching the first part of your speech, which reflects upon this
                                place, we shall endeavour to make it good by the hospitality
                                and entertainment we shal command to be given You and your Train, as also by
                                the rare Objects which you shall see: But as for the second part of your
                                speech, which relates to my self, and to the power of
                                Transmutations; I must tell you, that what I act this way, is
                                by a special dispensation from above, for the punishment of Humane vice in
                                an analogical or sympathetic way, according to the quality thereof, and the
                                humors of the men: I say, it is by the permission and Fiat of the
                                Almighty, the great God of Nature, that I do operat, not by any prestigious
                                charmes, or confederacy with Cacodaemons; not by fascinations or philtres,
                                by spels or sorceries, as the shallow-pated common people imagine I do, and
                                so traduce me of Witchcraft, and Negromancy; yet, I confess, 'tis by way of
                                Magick I act; for Magick was the first Philosophy among those acute
                                Nations which are neerest the rising Sun, so that Magus or
                                Magitian signified nothing else but a Wiseman, which afterwards
                                came to be traduced, and taken in an ill sense; As it hath been the fate of
                                Tyrant, Sophister, and other words besides, to incurre the same
                                destiny, and I pray the same destiny may not befall the word
                                Parlement.</span><span class="speech-act"><span class="speaker">Pererius.</span> Most

                                enriching of my knowledge, and satisfying my curiosity, I humbly desire to see some of
                                those Human Cretures
                                that you have anthropomorphos'd, and transform'd to brute Animals. </span><span
                                class="speech-act"><span class="speaker">Morphandra.</span> I shall willingly comply
                                with your curiosity and desire in this kind; for
                                you shall not only be brought to the sight of them, but you shall mingle
                                speech with them, and interrogat what you shall think fitting concerning
                                their present condition. </span><span class="speech-act"><span
                                    class="speaker">Pererius.</span> But, Madam, how can that be? how can I expect that
                                they should be capable of
                                what I speak, and consequently What answers or replies shall I hope to
                                receive from them, while they continue in the shapes of brute cretures? </span><span
                                class="speech-act"><span class="speaker">Morphandra.</span> Let that be your least care;
                                for during that intervall of time, I shall
                                re-infuse into them the faculty both of Reson and
                                Ratiocination, whereby you may confer and discourse freely with
                                them by interlocutions; Nor only so, but for a further argument of the great
                                esteem I have of you Prince Pererius, and for the heightning of
                                your welcom to my Court, as also that you may make som reall
                                returns of your voyage hither, if you can induce and fairly
                                perswade any of them to reassume the shapes of Human cretures, and to be
                                invested again in their former condition, I shall give my free and full
                                assent thereunto; nay, to oblige you yet further, I shall give way that you
                                take them a ship board with you, and transport them to their own Country, or
                                whither you please besides; Provided that it be a spontaneous act, and that
                                you have their voluntary election to this effect; for the universal Law
                                tells us, that Volenti non fit injuria, An unforc'd will cannot be
                                wronged.</span><span class="speech-act"><span class="speaker">Pererius.</span> Most
                                admired Princess, you engage me beyond all measure or meanes of
                                retaliation, beyond all degrees of gratitude, and me-thinks by these high
                                civilities you have wrought a sudden kind of transformation in me, for I find my self
                                all transformed to
                                admiration, to a thing of wonder, by these unparallel'd favours. All that I
                                can say for the present is, that, what air soever I breath; under what
                                climat soever blessed Heavens shall shed their influences upon me, I shall
                                blazon forth your nobleness for such transcendent favors all the world over.
                            </span><span class="speech-act"><span class="speaker">Morphandra.</span> We use not such
                                Complements under this Meridian, such a distance doth not
                                use to be 'twixt the Heart and the Tongue; they are neerer Relatives here.
                                But, before you go to exchange words with these Animals, take this
                                Advertisement before-hand, that ther are no wild or ferocious devouring
                                cretures within the Circumference of this Ile; they live all in a gentle and
                                general community, in an innocuous freedom, and sociableness: The Panther,
                                Bear, and Tyger, put off their belluine fierce nature here; the Lamb will
                                play with the Lion without any apprehensions of fear; the Hart fears not the
                                Hound, nor the Hare the Greyhound, nor the Bore the Lime-hound; the silly
                                Sheep fear not the Wolf or the Butcher's knife; nor Fish nor Fowl fear here
                                the Dragnet or Tramell: but all Animals, both of Air, Earth, and Water, live
                                in an innocent security; the reason being, that we neither kill, much lesse
                                feed upon any Creture here that hath blood, and a sensitive life, but upon
                                fruits, pulse, roots, rice, with other nourishing and manducable things,
                                that come forth gently, by the general benignity of indulgent Nature, from
                                the bowels of our common Mother the Earth; And though we make Butter
                                sometimes our aliment, we abhorre Cheese, because the cawle of a sensitive
                                kill'd creture serv'd for the Rennet. </span><span class="speech-act"><span

                                that this Iland is a part,
                                or some promontory of Paradise it self before Adam 's fall, which,
                                being slented off, and so got loose, was transported and fixed here; at
                                least, there are some grains of that mettal which went to the composition of
                                the Golden Age of the world still remaining here unconsumed. </span><span
                                class="speech-act"><span class="speaker">Morphandra.</span> Well, that I may acquit my
                                self of the promise I made unto you, Prince
                                Pererius, let us fetch a walk in those flowry fields towards
                                the banks of that River, to take in the freshness of the air, with the
                                fragancy of those Vegetals: And now, in a favourable conjuncture of time, I
                                spy a metamorphosed Creture among those seggs, fit for your purpose; It is
                                an Otter, whom I remember to have transmuted from a Mariner or
                                Seaman, for his deboshments here; and I observe, ther are no people so given
                                to excesses as Seamen when they come ashore; which yet may be somwhat
                                excused, for it is to recompence the hardships they endured at Sea: Nor was
                                it an improper change for me to metamorphos the
                                <span>Hydraulian</span><span>Hollandish</span> Mariner
                                to that shape; for as the Otter is a kind of Amphibious creture,
                                living partly by water, and partly by land, so a Mariner, Navigator, or
                                Fisherman, useth to do: but there was another reson which induced me to this
                                transmutation, for it related to the quality of the Countrey whence he
                                sprung, which is so inlayed, and every where so intercutt, and indented with
                                the Sea, or fresh navigable Rivers, that one cannot tell what to call it,
                                either water or land; besides, the Inhabitants dwell so low, that they lye
                                lower than the Sea in some places. And now you may make your approaches, and
                                parly with him accordingly, while I walk up the River to visit my Nymphs.

                                aversion thus, to become Man again. </span><span class="speech-act"><span
                                    class="speaker">Otter.</span> Truly, Sir, though Man doth vaunt, and cry up him
                                self, to be the Epitome
                                and Lord Paramount among all sublunary Cretures, though he vainly entitle
                                himself, the Microcosm, yet I hold him to be the most miserable of
                                all others; Go to his prime faculty, Reson, which, as he saith, is
                                the specifical difference that distinguisheth him from us, I have found,
                                that it fills his brain full of distraction, of extravagant opinions, and
                                whimseys, of pining griefs, panting doubts, and pannick fears, of violent
                                fancies and imaginations, which oftentimes turn to phrensies; it tortures
                                him with vexation and inquietude of spirit, insomuch, that som of the
                                profoundest Philosophers, as I have heard, affirmed, that the Rational
                                Soul was given to Man for his Self-punishment and Martyrdom; he may
                                be said to be his own Tormentor, and the greatest Tyrant to himself; nay,
                                these cruciatory passions do operat somtimes with such a violence, that they
                                drive him to despair, and oftentimes to murther and destroy himself, before
                                Nature hath exspird her due cours in him, all which, we, that are guided
                                only by sense, are not subject unto; We only look upon the present
                                object before our eyes, and take no other care but for shelter, and food,
                                and to please our appetit only. </span><span class="speech-act"><span
                                    class="speaker">Pererius.</span> 'Tis true, that all these turbulences, and
                                perplexities of spirit proceed
                                from the Rational faculty; but, in com pensation thereof, we have
                                by this Faculty the prero gative to know our Creator, to contemplat his
                                works, and the fair fabrique of the World; by this, we have a dominion and
                                Empire over all other Elementary Cretures, both of Air, Earth, and Water; by
                                the reach of this, Man with his crampons and harping-irons can draw ashore
                                the great Leviathan; He can make the Dromedary and Camel to kneel down, and
                                take up his burden; He can make the fierce Bull to endure his yoke; He can
                                bring down the Vulture from his nest; by this he can ride upon the back of
                                the vast Ocean, and with his winged Coursers ride post from one Pole to the other, as
                                you know well by your
                                own Profession, when you were Man and Mariner. </span><span class="speech-act"><span
                                    class="speaker">Otter.</span> Yet these advantages com short, in my judgment, to
                                countervail those
                                calamities that are incident to the Rational Creture, which makes him come
                                puling, crying, &amp; sometimes weeping into the world, as foreteling his
                                future miseries. But now that I have partly dis played the discomposures and
                                vexations of his mind, I will give a touch of those infirmities that his
                                Body is subject unto, which is no other than a Magazin of malignant humors;
                                a hull, wherein is stow'd a cargazon of numberless diseases, of putrid and
                                ugly corruptions, insomuch that, as, in his life time, whiles he sleeps in
                                the bosom of his causes within the Womb, ther's no Creture lies
                                neerer the excrementitious parts, so ther is none whose excrements are more
                                faetid, and stinking; the fewmets of a Deer, the lesses of
                                a Fox, the crotells of a Hare, the dung of a Horse, and
                                the spraints that I use to void backward, are nothing so foetid;
                                which may be the cause why, after Man's death, ther's no carcase so gastly
                                and noisom as his, so that Toads and Serpents engender often in his scull;
                                nor is his cadaver good for any thing when life is gone. 'Tis tru, Mummy may
                                be made of it, but it must be don by embalment, and great expence of Spices.
                                But many things in our carcases after death, serve for divers uses, as
                                particularly in mine; my Liver, reduced to powder, is good against the Flix
                                and Cholic; my Stones or testicles against the Palsie; and my Skin is of
                                such value, that the fairest Ladies will be glad to wear it, &amp;c. </span><span

                                speak of Human bodies, but all this comes
                                accidentally; it proceeds from variety of viands, esculents, and beverages,
                                not from the primitive plastick vertu, and ordinance of nature: Moreover,
                                that which makes them so subject to putre faction, is, because they abound
                                in heat and humidity more than other bodies, which oftentimes makes som parts of the

                                to your first Beeing, whereby, when this transitory life is ended, you may
                                be made capable to live in the Land of Eternity; whereas all brute Ani mals,
                                whose Souls soar no higher than the sense, are born to have a

                                to be redintegrated into your first Principles, &amp; so return to your own
                                Country, and Kinred, to go on still in your Calling, which is a
                                useful and thriving Profession, in the practise whereof you may see the

                                my self, that a Mariner in a storm is a Saint, but when the storm is
                                over he is a Mariner again; witness He, who in a dangerous tempest
                                made a Vow to offer a Wax-taper as big as his Mainmast unto Saint
                                Nicolas, if he would preserve him from shipwrack; but being com
                                safe ashore, a Rush-can dle did serve the turn; so that, nautical piety is
                                of no longer duration than the danger. </span><span class="speech-act"><span

                                it is a necessary and
                                noble Vocation, so it affords more frequent opportunities to improve a Man's
                                devotion to Heven, if one makes right use of it; which cannot be don more
                                properly, than by comparing the frail Vessel wherein he sayls to his own

                                Sir, to deal freely with you, I am quite out of conceit with,
                                both: Touching the first; for me to remove hence thither, were
                                to go from a fair flowry field into a great bogg, or a kind of quagmire, for
                                such a thing my Countrey may be called, if you have regard to the quality of
                                the soil, in comparison of This: It is, for the most part, a foggy cobwebb'd
                                air; so canopied over, as it were, with thick fuliginous clowds, as if it
                                were but one great Brew-house; they fence out both the Aquatical
                                Creatures from their right habitations, and the true Prince of the
                                Countrey from his hereditary possessions; insomuch, that some do not stick
                                to call them double Usurpers: It is one of the most infimous and lowest part
                                of the terrestrial Globe; which made one say, that they were the neerest
                                confederats and neighbors to Beelzebub. And this may be inferred
                                also out of their natures and disposition: for openly or covertly, they
                                have blown the bellows of all the Warrs (now Warr is a fire, struck
                                always in the Devil's tinder box ) that have happen'd round about
                                them, ever since their Revolt from
                                <span class="cypher">Tumontia</span><span class="decypher">Spain</span>, and since they
                                invol'd <span class="cypher">Artonia</span><span class="decypher">France</span>, &amp;
                                <span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher">England</span> in their
                                quarrell, who first rais'd them to a
                                Free-State; though I believe they have repented of it since.
                                Add hereunto that som do doubt, Whether God and Nature did ever design that
                                lump of coagulated Earth for the Mansion of Mankind; for of it self it
                                produceth neither Bread to eat, nor Stone to build, nor Wool or Silk to
                                cloath him, nor Wood or Cole, or other combustible stuff, for fuel; but the
                                Inhabitants use to fish for Fire in the Water, for (fresh) Water in the
                                Air, and for Air out of Foggs; insomuch, that if ever any Countrey may be
                                call'd a Noun Adjective, surely 'tis that, for it cannot stand by
                                it self. I remember, while I woar the shape of Man in that dull Clime,
                                me-thought my blood was like so much Bonny-clabber within my Body, which I
                                find now to be more quick, spriteful, and hot; though my bloud in statu
                                quo nunc be observed, I confess, to be the coldest of any
                                Quadrupedals. Moreover, I found that Mammon and Gain
                                was their chiefest God, and Gold their greatest Idol: but for the public
                                Religion which they profess, they have it but in a luke-warm
                                degree; ther's scarce any heat of holiness, and devotion among most of them.
                            </span><span class="speech-act"><span class="speaker">Pererius.</span> I find now that you

                                make a compensation for them; for they are one of the most industrious race
                                of People upon Earth; so that the whole Countrey may be compar'd to a Hive
                                of Bees, or Bank of provident Ants: They are the only Men that do Miracles
                                now adayes; they are those, who put boundaries to the raging Ocean, and by
                                rare repercussions beat back his turgid and overwhelming billows, yet they
                                reserve a power to command him in, at pleasure; they are those Men, who know
                                the true Mysteries of Commerce, and how to
                                regular it so, as to bring Trade and Policy to a Science, and
                                certain Principles. How much are they to be commended for their
                                neatness? Go to their Ships, they may be said to be as cleanly as a
                                milking-pail; in their Kitchins, the out side of their Utensils are as
                                bright as the inside; ther's never a room in their house, where so much dust
                                may be found as to draw the name of Slutt upon it: There is no
                                Countrey where there are fewer sorts of indigent and poor people, or where
                                they who are poor are better lodg'd, and provided for. 'Tis true, they are
                                somwhat heavy in motion, and dullish, which must be imputed to the quality
                                of the Clime; but this dulness is recompenc'd with a grave advisedness, and
                                circumspection in their Counsels; with a constancy, and perseverance
                                afterwards, in their Actions. In fine, they are a peeple who truly
                                understand their own Interest, which may be said to be the prime Principle
                                of Wisdom, whereby they have fought themselves, from a company of Fishermen,
                                into a High and Mighty Common-wealth. </span><span class="speech-act"><span
                                    class="speaker">Otter.</span> Truly, Sir, 'tis pitty that you had not a better
                                subject to spend your
                                Oratory upon. Now, Sir, concerning my former Profession, let me
                                tell you, that to be a Mariner, or Tarpaling, is one of the most
                                servile and slavish condition of life that can be, it is the most expos'd
                                to hardship and hazard; He was no fool, who made a question, Whether he
                                should number a Sea man 'twixt the Living or the Dead, being not much above
                                two inches distant from death, viz. the thickness of a rotten
                                plank: It may be also doubted, Whether he be a Free-man, or Prisoner, being
                                so coop'd up within so narrow a compass all the while. Touching the hardship
                                and toylsomness of this trade, let me tell you, that to plow, dig, delve, or
                                thresh, are but exercises of ease, compar'd to our labor in distress of
                                wether: How many times, when I went a fishing, did I carry isicles of frost
                                at my nose, and fingers-ends? How oft did I eat Bisket, so mouldy, that
                                danc'd up and down with ugly Maggots? How
                                oft did I stop my nostrils while I drunk stinking Beverage? How oft did the
                                stench of the Pump strike me into a swoon? But I thank the Fates,
                                and Queen Morphandra, I am now in a condition that I need not fear
                                hunger or cold, I have a good warm Coat about me, that will last me all my
                                life long, without patching or mending; which kind of fences against the
                                injuries of Time, and tyranny of the Meteors, indulgent Nature
                                provides for us sensitive Creatures, before we com into the World: whence
                                may be inferr'd, that She takes more care for Our preservation than she doth
                                of Mankinds; Beasts, have skins, Fish have scales, Birds have feathers, but
                                Man comes naked and wawling into the World, and cloaths himself afterwards
                                with our spoils: Nor hath he any habitation or ready food, provided him by
                                Nature; whereas other Animals find the Table layed, and the Buttry open for
                                them as soon as they are born, and come out of the bosom of their Causes;
                                whence it may be concluded, that they are the nobler Cretures. </span><span
                                class="speech-act"><span class="speaker">Pererius.</span> It is given for granted, that
                                Man comes naked into the World, yet he hath
                                the mastery and command, he hath the breaking, daunting, and disposing of
                                all other Cretures for his own turn, both in Air, Earth, &amp; Water, to
                                cloath and feed him, according to his free election and plesure; for all
                                other elementary Cretures are made for his use, and principally to that end.
                                Now 'tis a true Maxim, that the end is more noble than the
                                mediums that serve for that end, therefore in that point ther
                                can no comparison be made between us. </span><span class="speech-act"><span

                                other Cretures to array
                                and nourish you, but much labor and toyl must be used, before you can bring
                                them to serve your turn; What a deal of work must precede, ere the Tanner
                                and Furrier can make our Skins fit for your wear? What huge varieties of
                                labors must go before, ere Wheat come to be
                                made Bread, and Barly Drink? Ther must be ploughing, harrowing, sowing,
                                weeding, reaping, sheafing, stacking, barning, threshing, winnowing,
                                sacking, grinding, bolting, fermenting, and baking, before you can get a bit
                                of Bread to keep you from starving: What a deal of stirr must be us'd,
                                before you can get a Shirt on your back, or a handkercher to wipe your noses
                                withall? There must be planting, cutting down, hundling, watring,
                                rippling, braking, wingling, and heckling of Hemp; which laberinth
                                of labors and fatigues, we sentiant Cretures are free from. </span><span

                                tru, that Man is born to sundry sorts of labors,
                                but it is principally to exercise his spirits, and the faculties of the
                                intellect, and so preserve him from the rust of idleness, which makes the
                                greatest Princes and Potentates among men to have som manual Trade,
                                wherewith to passe away som part of their time. But, Otter, let us
                                word away time no longer; let me know positively, whether you
                                will make use of this singular favor, now offered you by
                                Morphandra, with my proposal, and advice, to reassume your
                                former nature, wherein you may so serve &amp; praise your Creator, that may
                                make you capable of Eternity. In your whole life you cannot meet
                                with so fair an opportunity; for I have a Ship to transport you, and you
                                shall be well cloth'd, and cover'd, with accomodation of all things els
                                accordingly; therefore take Time by the Foretop, for he is bald behind, and
                                you cannot take hold of him. </span><span class="speech-act"><span

                                this while by your perswasions; and whereas you speak of Eternity,
                                it may be an Eternity of torments as well as of bliss, I'le none of that.

                                after we have run out our cours here; for we likewise have Souls in us, and
                                certain expressions that countervail Speech, which is only
                                understood by the Great God of Nature himself, whom we do not use to offend
                                by any transgression of Laws, as you do. But I feel the Sun dart his rays somwhat quick,
                                therfore I will go to refresh
                                and solace my self in the gentle strems of that River.</span></p>
