                        of the terrestrial Globe; which made one say, that they were the neerest

                        also out of their natures and disposition: for openly or covertly, they

                        Add hereunto that som do doubt, Whether God and Nature did ever design that
                        lump of coagulated Earth for the Mansion of Mankind; for of it self it
                        produceth neither Bread to eat, nor Stone to build, nor Wool or Silk to

                        Inhabitants use to fish for Fire in the Water, for (fresh) Water in the
                        Air, and for Air out of Foggs; insomuch, that if ever any Countrey may be
                        call'd a Noun <span class="original_italics">Adjective,</span> surely 'tis that, for it cannot stand by

                        afterwards, in their Actions. In fine, they are a peeple who truly

                        and toylsomness of this trade, let me tell you, that to plow, dig, delve, or
                        thresh, are but exercises of ease, compar'd to our labor in distress of
                        wether: How many times, when I went a fishing, did I carry isicles of frost
                        at my nose, and fingers-ends? How oft did I eat Bisket, so mouldy, that

                        Legacies left by sweet devoted souls. Touching the first, 'tis too <br><span class="page_number">page 19</span><br> well known, that the very <span class="original_italics">Tallies,</span>

                        'tis tru, that about four millions were remitted in the year 1648. Then the
                        Gabell of <span class="original_italics">Salt</span> amounts to about seven millions every year, which is
                        look'd unto so narrowly, that a poor Peasan cannot carry a pocket or
                        purse-full of salt home to his poor wife, but he must be searched. Then ther
                        are the <span class="original_italics">Taillons, Aydes, Droits,</span> with divers other Impositions and
                        Taxes, which though at first they were pretended to be impos'd for the

                        Crowns, and no wonder, ther being in that Country, besides

                        number. <br> Then comes in the <span class="original_italics">Noblesse,</span> or Gentry, which have all the rest;
                        Insomuch that betwixt these three, the poor Commoner, who yet makes up the
                        bulk of the Nation, useth to be grinded as betwixt so many milstones, whence
                        grew this saying, that the <span class="original_italics"><span class="proverb"><span class="cypher">Artonian</span><span class="decypher d-none">French</span> Peasans are born with Chains</span>:</span>
                        Yet they are the supporters of all the other three, and whence they have
                        their subsistence; Insomuch that <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Artonia</span><span class="decypher d-none">France</span></span> may be compar'd to a
                        stately Palace, born up by mud-pillars; While the poor toyling peasan melts
                        the hoar frost with the sweat that trickles down his cheeks, others by good
                        fire-sides drink carowses in the wine which he plants, while he with his
                        panting breath and anhelation <br><span class="page_number">page 20</span><br> thickens the
                        air befor him, others with Carrolls and wanton musicall Catches do attenuat
                        it. <br> Concerning the second point I spoke of, <span class="original_italics">viz.</span> That no Country hath
                        <span class="original_italics">more peeple and fewer men</span> then <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Artonia</span><span class="decypher d-none">France</span>, </span> 'tis a truth

                        <span class="original_italics">Exactions,</span> and heavy <span class="original_italics">Rents</span> besides to their Landlords,
                        that they use to grow so dejected, pusillanimous, and heartless, their
                        spirits come to be so cowed and cowardiz'd, that not one in twenty hath the
                        courage of a man in him, or is found fit to shoulder a Musket, to trail a

                        not do it; But, Sir, touching my <span class="original_italics">Ears,</span> you need not take me by them
                        in so reproachfull a manner: for you know a <span class="original_italics">Phrygian King</span> did wear
                        once an <span class="original_italics">Asse</span> his ears, and he was the richest that ever was among
                        Mortalls; Besides, my <span class="original_italics">Ears</span> have a prophetic vertu, for when I prick
                        them up, 'tis an infallible presage <br><span class="page_number">page 22</span><br> of foul
                        wether; Touching my <span class="original_italics">braying,</span> it is the tone which Nature hath given
                        me, and all the Indi vidualls of my kind, and you must grant, that Nature
                        the handmaid of God Almighty doth not use to do any thing ill-favouredly;
                        But in lieu of our <span class="original_italics">braying</span> you have a passion, and as I remember
                        your Philosophers call it the <span class="original_italics">proper passion</span> of man, that is a far
                        more distorting and ridiculous violent posture, 'tis your <span class="original_italics">Laughter,</span>
                        which happens when your pleasure hath the liberty to scatter it self abroad,
                        and that the senses bear a share therin, for then it causeth such an
                        agitation, that the whole physiognomy of the face is changed, it begins to
                        sparkle in the eyes, and mingleth it self oft-times with forc'd tears, the
                        fore-head stretcheth it self, the lips grow redd, they tremble and slaver
                        often-times, the voice becomes grosser then ordinary, and resounds, the rest
                        of the body is subject to this agitation, an unusuall heat and vapor shedds
                        it self through all its parts, which swells, and gives a new color, the
                        eye-brows decline, the lidds contract themselves, and all the skin about
                        them becomes uneven, and wrinkles it self all over, the eyes extenuat, they
                        half shut themselfs, and grow humid, the nose crumples up, and growes sharp,
                        the lipps retire and lengthen, ther is an ill-favor'd kind of gaping, and
                        discovery of the teeth, the cheeks lift up themselfs and grow more stiff,
                        they have pitts digg'd in them during the time, the mouth is forc'd to open,
                        and discovers the tremblings of the suspended toung, it thrusts out an
                        obstreperous interrupted sound, and oftentimes ther is a stopping of breath,
                        the neck swells and shortens it self, all the veins grow greter, and
                        extended, an extraordinary hue disperseth it self over all the face, which
                        grows reddish, the brest is impetuously agitated, and with sudden
                        reiterated shakes, that it hinders respiration, the perfect use of speech is
                        lost, and it is impossible to swallow during the fit, a pain rises in the
                        flanck, the whole body bends, and as it were wreaths and gathers it self
                        together, the hands are set on the sides, and presse them forcibly, <br><span class="page_number">page 23</span><br> sweat gets up on the face, the voice is
                        lost in hickocks, and the breath is stifled with sighs; somtimes this
                        agitation gets to so high an excesse, that it produceth the same violent
                        effect as medicaments use to do, which is to put the bones so out of joynt
                        that it causeth syncopes; The head and the arms suffer the same throws, with
                        the brest and the thighs, the body hurles it self with precipitation and
                        disorder, and is cast from one side to the other; The hands becom feeble,
                        the leggs cannot support themselves, and the body is constrained to fall,
                        and tumble, nay it causeth sometimes dangerous syncopes in the heart, and
                        so brings death. <span class="original_italics">Weeping</span> also the counter-passion hath many of
                        these ill-favor'd motions, what an odd kind of face doth an infant make
                        assoon as he is born? how som of ripe age will screech, cry and howle in so
                        many disordered notes, and singultient accents? Whereas we by our

                        into the open aire, without any forc'd tones, or such variety of distorted

                        over her: for it hath been observed that those three scourges of Heven, λιμοσ, λοιμοσ, and πολεμοσ, the Famine, the Plague, and the civill Warrs
                        are consecutif, and use to follow one another, though the last hath got the
                        start of the other two; But concerning the peeple, I verily believe ther
                        were never any so far degenerated since the Devill had to do with mankind,
                        never any who did fool and puppifie themselfs into such a perfect slavery
                        and confusion; You seem to pitty my transfiguration from <span class="original_italics">Man</span> to
                        <span class="original_italics">Ape,</span> but their case is to be much more resented, for they are

                        and devour one another in so savage a manner; All which proceeds from a sad
                        disease which hath seiz'd upon many thousands of them, it is a pure
                        <span class="original_italics">Scotomia,</span> an odd <br><span class="page_number">page 30</span><br> kind of
                        <span class="original_italics">Vertigo</span> that reigns amongst them, which turns the head round,
                        and fills it with new chimera's ever and anon; 'Tis tru that my country-men
                        were ever observ'd to be inconstant in the fashion of their cloathing, in
                        their outward comportment and garbs, which proceeded from <span class="original_italics">Imitation</span>
                        more then naturall <span class="original_italics">Inclination;</span> But this mimicall apish humor hath
                        extended of late years not onely to their externall <span class="original_italics">habits,</span> but to
                        the inward <span class="original_italics">habitudes</span> of their minds, and taken hold of their
                        Intellectualls, by being carried away with every wind of Doctrine, and
                        fanaticall newfangled opinions, blown over from other Countreys, and then
                        multiplying amongst them; For though my countrey-men have not any great
                        Genius to <span class="original_italics">invent,</span> yet 'tis observ'd they have a faculty to
                        <span class="original_italics">add</span> to any new invention; and if any new odd opinion in Holy
                        things hath once taken footing among them, they will make it run upon more
                        feet; Now it is in <span class="original_italics">Divinity</span> as in <span class="original_italics"> Philosophy, Uno absurdo dato

                        like ill weeds do grow apace; And truly I must confesse, that this apish
                        humor had seiz'd strongly upon me, which made me distrub the peace of the
                        holy Church wherin I was born, baptized, and bred, which made Queen
                        <span class="original_italics">Morphandra</span> to transform me justly to this shape you see, being
                        entertain'd Chaplain to a Man of War that arriv'd at this Island, though I
                        had been sensible of mine own errors a good while before. <br></p>

                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> I know well that there was in <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher d-none">England</span></span> a comely face of a Church;
                        Ther were such solemnities, venerations, and decencies us'd, that might
                        discover som piety in the practice of holy duties; Ther was a public Liturgy
                        that link'd the souls of the whole Nation in an unanimity, wherin ther were
                        such pithy patheticall prayers that reached all occasions, and searched
                        every crany in the conscience; The Sacraments were administred with a
                        fitting posture of reverence, and genuflexion, yet far from any
                        superstition; God's houses <br><span class="page_number">page 31</span><br> were kept neat,
                        cleanly, and in repair; There was such a prudent handsom Government, such
                        degrees of promotion, such possessions annex'd to the Church, that made them
                        of that holy function not onely to be esteem'd and reverenc'd, but to be
                        able to do deeds of charity; But now I hear ther's crept up such a nasty
                        race of miscreants, who have no more esteem of God Almighty's House than of
                        a Pig-sty, who have turn'd a pretended <span class="original_italics">Superstition</span> to a palpable
                        <span class="original_italics">Prophanenes,</span> who have plunder'd all that belong'd to pious
                        uses, who have nothing of that veneration, that sweetnes, and comfort that
                        useth to attend tru devotion, which is turn'd to a giddy zeal, or a kind of
                        <span class="original_italics">lust</span> still after more learning, as if <span class="original_italics">Christianity</span> had
                        no consistence or certainty, no sobriety; or end of knowledg, wherin the
                        inward man might acquiesce; These poor simpletons pretending to imitate the
                        Apostles time wold have the same form of Discipline and Mode to govern whole
                        Nations, as it did at first a Chamber-full of men in the Infancy of the
                        Christian Church; They wold mak the same coat serve our Saviour at five and
                        twenty years, as fitted him at five: But you were speaking of other
                        dreadfull judgments that you believe were hanging over <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher d-none">England</span>,</span>

                        <h6 class="speaker">Ape.<br></h6> I remember when I had a human shape I was much addicted to the reading of
                        <span class="original_italics">History,</span> which is a profitable knowledge, for the observation
                        of former actions may serve to regulat the future; I took notice of a world
                        of examples that the two nefandous crimes of <span class="original_italics">Sacrilege</span> and
                        <span class="original_italics">Perjury</span> never went unpunished without some signall judgments;
                        Among divers other these two do reign and rage in <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher d-none">England</span></span> more
                        then they ever did in any Country under the cope of Heven, and must she not
                        then expect the vialls of a just vengeance to fall down upon Her from above?
                        But that you may better understand the state of that calamitous Country,
                        that Country of confusion, I will recount to you what befell me before my

                        During the said time I thought I was transported to the remotest place, and
                        of the greatest distance that possibly could be from Heven, me thought I was
                        in the <span class="original_italics">Infernall pit,</span> in the kingdom of darknesse, in Hell it self
                        among the devills and damned spirits, I had neither that golden branch, nor

                        which was presently upon the appeerance of the last blazing Star 1618.
                        <span class="original_italics">Pluto</span> vouchsafed to be present at this solemn Councell, and to
                        be President or <span class="original_italics">Chair-man</span> himself, to which purpose he had a strong

                        last happy Comet <span class="original_italics">Anno</span> 1618. which by the parallax was found to be
                        in the Heven it self above the Elementary world, we have for forty years
                        together been more active and eager in your Majesty's service than ever we
                        were; We have stirred the humors of the foolish Inhabitants of the earth to
                        insurrections, to warr and praeliation; To effect which, our practise hath
                        been to bring on the beggarliest and toughest peeple upon the nicest and
                        softest, we brought the <span class="original_italics">Cuprinian<span class="cypher">Cuprinian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Swede</span></span> upon the <span class="original_italics">Aetonian<span class="cypher">Aetonian</span><span class="decypher d-none">German</span>,</span> and

                        divers Princes out of their antient Inheritances, among others the Duke of
                        <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Laroni</span><span class="decypher d-none">Lorraine</span></span> and <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Rinarchus</span><span class="decypher d-none">Rhineland</span>,</span> we brought two gran

                        often puzzled <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Vinalia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Unidentified placeName</span>,</span> we have made the Kings of <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Artonia</span><span class="decypher d-none">France</span></span>
                        and <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Tumontia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Spain</span></span> to bandy so fiercely one against the other, as if the
                        one had been an <span class="original_italics">Infidell</span> the other a <span class="original_italics">Iew,</span> though each of
                        them had one another's sister abed with him every night. But may it please
                        your Acherontic Majesty to be inform'd, that the most advantageous and
                        signall services we have done, have bin in <br><span class="page_number">page 34</span><br>
                        the lsles of <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher d-none">England</span></span> and <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Hebrinia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Ireland</span>,</span> for whereas we divided
                        our selfs before, and went singly among other peeple, we went joyntly
                        thither all three, and brought a Regiment of fiery red-coated
                        <span class="original_italics">Cacodaemons</span> to guard us, because we might be sure to bring our
                        great work home to your Majesty's aime; The Nation fittest for our turn at
                        first were the <span class="original_italics">Carboncian<span class="cypher">Carboncian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Scotsmen</span>,</span> who have bin so obedient to their Kings,
                        that of above a hundred they brag of, scarce two parts of three died in
                        their beds, but were made away violently; We did incite them first against
                        their own Country-man and <span class="original_italics">Native King,</span> and to appear in a daring
                        high hostile manner before him upon the borders; At which time it cost us a
                        great deal of artifice so to besot the <span class="original_italics"><span class="sic">Gherioniams</span><span class="correction d-none">Gherionians</span><span class="cypher">GherioniamsGherionians</span><span class="decypher d-none">Englishmen</span>,</span> and to abase
                        their courage, so to entangle them with Factions, having sure Confidents to
                        that end among them, that they durst not present Battle to the <span class="original_italics">Carboncian<span class="cypher">Carboncian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Scotsmen</span></span> at that time; And this, Sir, was an important piece of
                        service, for had they fought then, or had they bin sensible afterwards of
                        the dishonour they receiv ed at that time, their King being then amongst
                        them in person, with the flower of his Nobility and Gentry, and consequently
                        had they stuck to him afterwards to have vindicated that rebellious affront,
                        all those we have fomented since might have bin prevented. <br> We shortly after transmitted the same spirit of Insurrection into
                        <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Hebrinia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Ireland</span>,</span> who being encouraged by the good successes of the
                        <span class="original_italics">Carboneian,</span> who got then what tearms he listed, yet could he
                        not sit quiet; and the <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Hebrinian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Irish</span></span> Commissioners being but harshly
                        entertain'd by the great Councell of <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher d-none">England</span>,</span> who intended to send
                        them over a Governour that should pinch them more than they were before in
                        their consciences, and for divers other provocations, we caus'd the
                        <span class="original_italics">Hebrinian<span class="cypher">Hebrinian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Irishman</span></span> also to rise in blood, which he did to som purpose;
                        Then came we to work upon the <span class="original_italics">Gherionian<span class="cypher">Gherionian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Englishman</span>, </span> whom we found as fit
                        to receive our impression as flax is to receive fire, in regard of their
                        long Furseit of peace and plenty; We broke up one great <br><span class="page_number">page 35</span><br> Assembly upon a suddain, because the members
                        therof were not for our turn, But then we call'd another which was fit for
                        our purpose, and we steer'd their courses all the while with a great deal of
                        care; The first thing we did was to endue them with a faculty to
                        <span class="original_italics">create</span> fears and jealousies, whereof we made excellent use, and
                        although those fears and jealousies appeared afterwards to every common man
                        as plain as the nose on his face to be but meer forgeries, and
                        supposititious things, yet we did still so intoxicat their intellectualls,
                        that we made them to adore still the <span class="original_italics">coyners</span> of them; And to give
                        your <span class="original_italics">Stygian</span> Majesty among divers others, one most pregnant and
                        unde niable demonstration what firm footing we got in that <span class="original_italics">Island,</span>
                        we did raise in few years more <span class="original_italics">Pythonesses,</span> which the ignorant
                        vulgar call Witches there, then ever were in that Country since your Majesty
                        tempted <span class="original_italics">Eve;</span> and we enabled our said <span class="original_italics">Pythonesses</span> to send
                        their inferiour <span class="original_italics">Imps</span> abroad upon our service; We stood at the
                        King's elbow when he pass'd the <span class="original_italics">Act of continuance,</span> wherein a
                        <span class="original_italics">Carboncian<span class="cypher">Carboncian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Scotsman</span></span> was our chief Engineer; But the great City
                        <span class="original_italics">Polihaima</span> stood us in most excellent steed to compasse our
                        designes, we made the riffraff and rakehells of that wanton City, whom som
                        call'd <span class="original_italics">Myrmidons,</span> others their <span class="original_italics">Bandogs,</span> to rabble the King
                        out of Town, we brought also thither the silly Swains of the Country like a
                        flock of Geese to gaggle up and down the streets with papers in their hats
                        they knew not about what; We managed the businesse afterwards so dextrously,
                        and did aggravate things by degrees, that we made their credulous King,
                        because he was so profess'd an enemy to your Majesty, to go disguis'd in
                        serving-man's habit to his Country-men the <span class="original_italics">Carboncians<span class="cypher">Carboncians</span><span class="decypher d-none">Scotsmen</span>,</span> with whom
                        we prevail'd so far, that they delivered him over as a Sacrifice, and
                        betraid him <span class="original_italics">Iudas</span> like to the <span class="original_italics">Gherionians<span class="cypher">Gherionians</span><span class="decypher d-none">Englishmen</span>,</span> who crucified
                        him sufficiently afterwards by tossing and tumbling him up and down, by
                        depriving him of the comfort of all things that use to be dear unto man, as
                        his wife, children, friends, and servants, by working upon his <br><span class="page_number">page 36</span><br> conscience in a compulsatory way, and stretching
                        it upon the very tenter; In summe, we have reduc'd that Country to a
                        conformity with this of your Majesties, to a perfect Chaos of all confusion,
                        we have brought the sway into the common peeples hands, making all the
                        <span class="original_italics">Nobility</span> and <span class="original_italics">Gentry</span> to crouch and cringe unto them;
                        And never did common peeple more truly act the part, and discover the genius
                        of a common peeple more lively, whose nature is still thirsting after
                        novelties, and <span class="original_italics">Utopian</span> Reformations, though oftentimes they fool
                        themself thereby into a a baser kind of slavery, finding when 'tis too late
                        those specious idaea's, and confus'd forms of Government they apprehended at
                        first, and hugg'd in their own conceits, to be at last but meer absurdities,
                        when they com to the application and practise therof. <br> And, Sir, the most advantageous instruments we have us'd to bring all this
                        about have bin the <span class="original_italics">Pulpit</span> and the <span class="original_italics">Presse,</span> by these we
                        diffus'd those supposititious fears and jealousies, formerly spoken of, to
                        distract the brains of the silly vulgar; Instead of <span class="original_italics">Lights</span> we put
                        <span class="original_italics">Firebrands</span> in their Churches, who, according as we did dictat
                        unto them, did baul out nothing but sediti on, war, and blood; We have made
                        som of them to have as good an opinion of the <span class="original_italics">Alchoran</span> as of their
                        own <span class="original_italics">Liturgy;</span> We made new <span class="original_italics"> Ordinances </span> to batter down all
                        the antient <span class="original_italics">Canons</span> of the Church, we have made them to un-saint all
                        those who were call'd <span class="original_italics">Apostles,</span> to prophane and plunder all places
                        that were consecrated, we brought som of them to put a division 'twixt the
                        <span class="original_italics">Trinity</span> it self, we have brought them to keep their
                        <span class="original_italics">Fasts</span> more solemnly than the <span class="original_italics">Sabboth,</span> upon which day
                        we made them usually not onely to sit in Councell, but to put in execution
                        their chief designs of blood; To work all this, the main and most materiall
                        thing we made use of was <span class="original_italics">spirituall pride</span> your Majesty's old
                        acquaintance, which pride we have infus'd into the mind of every Mechanic,
                        or Country-Swain, who will boldly now undertake to expound any Text of
                        Scripture new or <br><span class="page_number">page 37</span><br> old upon the warrant of
                        his own giddy brain; Insomuch that we have made that Book which they call
                        the <span class="original_italics">Bible,</span> that was ordained for the Charter of their
                        <span class="original_italics">Salvation,</span> to be the chiefest instrument of their <span class="original_italics">
                           Damnation; </span> We have brought those exotic words <span class="original_italics">Plundring</span>
                        and <span class="original_italics">Storming,</span> and that once abominable word <span class="original_italics">Excise</span> to be
                        now familiar among them, they are all made free Denizens, and naturaliz'd
                        among them; We have made those who came petitioners for <span class="original_italics">peace</span> to
                        the great Councill to be ill intreated, and som of them to be murther'd, but
                        those that came for <span class="original_italics">warr</span> to be countenanc'd and thank'd; We made
                        the mother to betray her child, the child the father, the husband the wife,
                        and the servant his master; We have brought a perfect Tyranny over their
                        souls and bodies, upon the one, by tedious imprisonments and captivity, with
                        a forfeiture of all their livelihoods before conviction, or any preceding
                        charge, upon the other, by forcing them to take contradictory <span class="original_italics">Oaths,
                           Engagements,</span> and <span class="original_italics">Protestations;</span> On that foolish
                        superstitious day of <span class="original_italics">Christmas,</span> with other Festi vals, we have
                        brought them to shut up their Churches, and to open their Shops and
                        Shambles, so that in time they will forget the very memory of the
                        <span class="original_italics">Incarnation</span> of their Saviour; We have brought them to have as
                        little reverence of their <span class="original_italics">Temples</span> as of their <span class="original_italics">Tap-houses,</span>
                        and to hold the Church to be no more than a Charnell-house of rotten bones;
                        And though they still cringe and stand bare-headed before any wrangling
                        Bench of common pleading, yet we have so stiffned their joynts, and made
                        their heads so tender in that which they call God's House, that there, they
                        can neither bow the one, nor scarce uncover the other; We have made the
                        fundamentall Laws to be call'd but <span class="original_italics">meer formalities;</span> We have made
                        that which was call'd their Great Charter to be torn to a thousand flitters,
                        and stretcht the <span class="original_italics">priviledge</span> of the Commons so wide, that it hath
                        quite swallowed the Royall <span class="original_italics"> Prerogative, </span> and all other
                        priviledges; We have grub'd up, and cast away those hopefull Plants that
                        grew in <br><span class="page_number">page 38</span><br> their <span class="original_italics">two Seminaeries</span> of
                        Learning, and set in them graffs of our own choice; We have made the wealth
                        of Town and Country, of Poor and Rich, to shine in plunder upon the
                        Souldiers backs; We have made them command <span class="original_italics">free-quarter</span> of those,
                        that were more sitting to ask <span class="original_italics">alms</span> of them; We have made them rifle
                        the Monuments of the dead, to rob the very Laza retro, to strip the Orphan
                        and Widow; We have made them offer violence to the very Vegetables and
                        inanimat Stones, to violat any thing that was held holy, to make Socks of
                        Surplices, to water their beasts at the Font, and feed them on the Altar,
                        and to term the thing they cal the Sacrament to be but a two-penny Ordinary;
                        We have made them use on the close stoole that Book wherein the public
                        Devotion of the whole Nation consisted; In fine, we have made them turn
                        supposed superstition to gross prophaness, preaching to prating, praying to
                        raving, government to con fusion, and freedom to fetters; We have so
                        intoxica ted that dear daughter of yours <span class="original_italics">Polihaima,</span> that she knows
                        not what way to turn her self; And whereas her Apprentices did rise up like
                        so many Cubs of Tygers against their lawfull Prince, they are now becom as
                        came as so many silly sheep against the Souldiery; We have puzzled their
                        Pericranium with vertiginous fancies, and fears among themselfs, that one
                        neighbour dare not trust the other; To conclude, we have eclipsed the glory
                        of that Nation, we have made them by all peeple far and neer that ever had
                        knowledg, correspondence, or any commerce with them, to be pittied by som,
                        to be laugh'd at by others, to be scorn'd of all, and to becom the very tail
                        of all Nations; In fine, Sir, we have brought that Country to such a passe
                        of confusion, that it is a fit place onely for your infernall Majesty to
                        keep your Court in, for ther's never a <span class="original_italics">Crosse</span> there to fright you
                        now: 'Tis tru they retain it still upon their coines of gold and silver, in
                        honour of your <span class="original_italics">Plutonian</span> Highnesse as you are <span class="original_italics">Dis</span> and god
                        of riches. <br><span class="original_italics">Megaera</span> having thus given up an account in behalf <br><span class="page_number">page 39</span><br> of her self and her two sisters, they all bowed
                        their snaky heads down to their very feet, which were toed with Scorpions,
                        before the black Throne of <span class="original_italics"> Beelzebub, </span> who giving such a humm that
                        made all Hell to tremble, answered thus, <br> My pretious and most trusty <span class="original_italics">Tartarean</span> daughters, we highly approve
                        of the super-erogatory service you have don us for the propagation of our

                        time to have a lease of that <span class="original_italics">Iland,</span> and we hope to obtain it,
                        touching <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Carboncia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Scotland</span></span> 'tis not worth the while; Therfore when you have

                        this pit, I would have you return thither, and prepare that place for one of
                        our principall habitations, never leave them till you have thrust out

                        them; let the son seek the fathers throat, let brothers sheath their swords
                        in one anothers bowells, let the Country clash with the Towns, the Towns one
                        against the other, and the Sea with both, till that the whole Nation be at
                        last extinguished that one may not be left to pisse against a wall; Let not
                        a Church or Chappell, Hospitall or Colledge stand in the whole Isle. I
                        intend to have a new Almanack of Saints at my comming, for I have som
                        Star-gazers there fit for my purpose; Make haste therefore, and acquit your
                        selfs of your duty for fear a peace be shuffl'd up, and that

                        for your reward. <br> The three <span class="original_italics">Lethean</span> Futies with a most profound reverence replied,
                        May it please your Majesty, your Ferriman <span class="original_italics">Charon</span> is continually so
                        pestered with such multitudes of <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gherionian</span><span class="decypher d-none">English</span></span> and <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Carboncian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Scottish</span></span> passengers, <br><span class="page_number">page 40</span><br> that we were forc'd to stay a long time ere

                        Therfore we most humbly desire for our better expedition, that you would
                        vouchsafe to give us a speciall <span class="original_italics">Mandamus</span> that we may be serv'd
                        first, with a <span class="original_italics">non obstante,</span> when we com to the banks of
                        <span class="original_italics">Styx.</span><br> You shall dear daughters, said <span class="original_italics">Pluto,</span> and my Warrant shall be
                        addrest to som <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gherionian</span><span class="decypher d-none">English</span> Tarpalins,</span> wherof ther are abundance
                        these few years past, whom <span class="original_italics">Charon</span> hath entertaind for his
                        journey-men. <br> Having listned all this while unto what pass'd 'twixt <span class="original_italics">Pluto</span> and his
                        Furies, my guiding spirit did lead me up and down Hell to see the various
                        sorts of torments that are there, which indeed are innumerable both old and
                        new; The first I beheld was <span class="original_italics">Ixion</span> who was tyed with ugly Vipers to
                        a wheel that whirl'd about perpetually, and I might perceive a multitude of
                        lesser wheels newly made therabouts, wherunto great nombers of
                        <span class="original_italics">Gherionians<span class="cypher">Gherionians</span><span class="decypher d-none">Englishmen</span>,</span> and divers of my acquaintants were bound in like
                        manner; I might discern also hard by a huge company of new
                        <span class="original_italics">Windmills,</span> and bodies tyed with black-spotted Snakes at every
                        wing turning round perpetually; A little further ther were a great many
                        broken by <span class="original_italics">Milstones</span> who were whirl'd with them about incessantly;
                        In another place I might see black <span class="original_italics">Whirlpools</span> full of tormented
                        souls turning still round, I asked what was the reson of so many whirling
                        tortures? My good Spirit answered, All these, except <span class="original_italics">Ixion</span> 's
                        wheel, are new torments appointed for <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gherionian</span><span class="decypher d-none">English</span></span> Sectaries, who had
                        destroyed from top to bottom all Government both of Church and State, And as
                        their brains turn'd round upon earth after every wind of Doctrine, so their
                        souls turn here in perpetuall torments of rotation. <br> A little further I spied <span class="original_italics">Prometheus</span> removed thither from
                        <span class="original_italics">Caucasus,</span> with a ravenous Vulture tearing and feeding upon his
                        liver, which as one part was eaten, renewed presently after, and abundance
                        of new commers were tormented in the same manner, these <br><span class="page_number">page 41</span><br> I was told they were <span class="original_italics">Gherionian<span class="cypher">Gherionian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Englishmen</span>s</span> also
                        that were punishd like <span class="original_italics">Prometheus,</span> because as he was tortured so
                        for stealing fire from Heven, by which was meant for prying too far into the
                        secrets of the gods, so those fiery Zelots of <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher d-none">England</span></span> were
                        tortured, for offring to dive too far into the high points of
                        <span class="original_italics">Predestination, Election,</span> and <span class="original_italics">Reprobation,</span> being not
                        contented <span class="original_italics">sapere ad sobrietatem,</span> but were gaping ever and anon
                        after new lights, and flashes of illuminations to pry into the Book of Life. <br> Then I came to the bottomles Tub which <span class="original_italics">Danaus</span> daughters were a
                        filling, a nomberles company of other such tubs were there, and
                        <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gherionian</span><span class="decypher d-none">English</span></span> women and men were incessantly labouring to fill
                        them up with the stenchy black waters of <span class="original_italics">Acheron;</span> I was told that
                        they were those over-curious peeple in <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher d-none">England</span></span> which wold be never
                        satisfied with spirituall knowledg, having no other devotion than to be
                        alwaies <span class="original_italics">learning,</span> and never comming to the truth, as these poor
                        restlesse fillers could never come to any bottom. <br> Then I beheld the most horrid tortures of those Giants who wold have pulld
                        <span class="original_italics">Iupiter</span> out of his Throne, and a world of <span class="original_italics">Gherionians<span class="cypher">Gherionians</span><span class="decypher d-none">Englishman</span></span>
                        among them, who partaked of the same tortures, because they had conspir'd on
                        earth to destroy their lawfull King. <br> Not far further I might spy dazling my eyes fiery glowing tubs made
                        Pulpit-like, and I was told they were prepared for those prophane
                        presumptuous Mechanicks, and other lay-men who use to preach, and so abuse
                        the sacred Oracles of God; And <span class="original_italics">Uzza</span> was not far off, who lay in
                        torments there for being too bold with the Holy Ark. <br> Not far distant I saw hoops of iron that were made <span class="original_italics">Garter-like</span> of
                        hot candent steel, I was told that they were design'd for the perjur'd
                        Knights of that <span class="original_italics">Order</span> in <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher d-none">England</span></span> to wear upon their legs
                        when they com thither, for breaking in the late war the solemn Oath they had
                        taken at their Installment, to <span class="original_italics"> defend the Ho nour and Quarrells, the
                           Rights and Dignities of their So verain, &amp;c. </span><br> Nere unto them I might see brasse hoops glowing <br><span class="page_number">page 42</span><br> with fire, and they were <span class="original_italics">Scarfs-like,</span> I
                        was told they were ordained for those Knights of the <span class="original_italics">Bath</span> to wear
                        for Ribbands next their skins when they came thither, for infringing that
                        sacred <span class="original_italics">Sacramentall Oath</span> they took at their election, which was,
                        <span class="original_italics">To love their Soverain above all earthly creture, and for his Right
                           and Dignity to live and die.</span><br> A little beyond I saw a <span class="original_italics">Copper</span> -table with chairs of the same, all
                        candent hot, I was told that those were for perjur'd Privy-Councellors who
                        had broke their Oath to their King, which obliged them to <span class="original_italics">be tru and
                           faithfull servants unto him, and if they knew or understood any manner
                           of thing to be attempted, done, or spoken against his Majestie's Person,
                           Honour, Crown, or Dignity, they swore to lett and withstand the same to
                           the uttermost of their power, and cause it to be revealed either to
                           Himself, or any other of his Privy Councill.</span><br> Hard by I saw a little Furnace so glowing hot, that it lookt of the colour
                        of a <span class="original_italics">Ruby</span> or <span class="original_italics">Carbuncle,</span> I was told that it was to clap in
                        the Master of a King's Jewellhouse when he comes thither, for being so
                        perfidious and perjurious to his Master. <br> Not far off I might see a huge brasse Caudron full of molten lead, with som
                        Brewers cruelly tormented therein, for setting their own Country on fire. <br> I was curious to know, whether ther were any other infernall tortures
                        besides those of <span class="original_italics">fire;</span> Yes, I was answered, for to speak of
                        <span class="original_italics">fire</span> to a peeple habituated to a cold Climat were not onely to
                        make them slight Hell, but to have a mind to go thither; So my Spirit
                        brought me a little Northward, and shewed me a huge Lough, where ther were
                        frosted Mountains up and down, and I might discover amongst them a world of
                        <span class="original_italics">Blew-caps</span> lying in beds of yce, with their noses and toes nipt,
                        the isicles stuck to their fingers ends like horns, and a bleak hispid wind
                        blew incessantly upon them, they made the most pitteous noise that
                        me-thought I had heard in all Hell, for they wawl'd, screech'd, and howl'd
                        out ever and anon this dismall note, <span class="original_italics">Wea is me, wea is me that ever I
                           betraid my gid King.</span><br><br><span class="page_number">page 43</span><br> Among all those damned souls I desired to
                        see what punishment an <span class="original_italics">Atheist</span> had, my Spirit was ready to answer me, that ther were no <span class="original_italics">Atheists</span> in
                        Hell at all; 'tis tru they were so upon <span class="original_italics">Earth</span> before they came
                        hither, but here they sensibly find and acknowledge ther is a God by his
                        justice and judgments, for ther is here <span class="original_italics">poena sensûs</span> and <span class="original_italics">poena
                           damni,</span> ther is inward and outward torture, The outward torments you
                        behold are nothing so grievous as the inward regrets and agonies the souls
                        have, to have lost <span class="original_italics">Heven</span> wherof they were once capable, and to be
                        eternally forsaken by their <span class="original_italics">Creator</span> the Lord of Light, their
                        chiefest Good; Add hereunto that they know these torments to be endlesse,
                        easelesse, and remedilesse; Besides these qualities which are incident to
                        the damned souls, they have neither patience towards themselfs in their own
                        suffrances, nor any pitty towards others, but their natures is so accursed
                        that they wish their neighbours torments were still greter then their own;
                        Moreover their torments never lessen, or have any mitigation by tract of
                        time, or degrees of sense, but they persevere alwaies in the same heighth,
                        they are still fresh, and the soul made stronger to bear them; I saw that
                        <span class="original_italics">everlasting Villain</span> who committed one of the first sacriledges
                        we read of, by burning the Temple of <span class="original_italics">Diana,</span> whose torments were so
                        fresh and cruciatory upon him, as they were the first day he was hurl'd in
                        thither; <span class="original_italics">Iudas</span> was in the same degree and strength of torture as he
                        was the first moment he fell thither; <span class="original_italics">Iack Cade, Wat Tyler, Iack
                           Straw,</span> and <span class="original_italics">Ket the Tanner</span> did fry as fresh as they did
                        that very instant they were tumbled down thither; Amongst whom it made my
                        heart to melt within me when I saw som of their new-com'd Countrymen amongst
                        them, wherof I knew divers; And though <span class="original_italics">society</span> is wont to be some
                        solace to men in mi sery, yet they conceived no comfort at all by these
                        fresh companions. <br> It is high time for us now, said my good guiding Spirit, to be gone to the
                        other world, so we directed our cours towards the Ferry upon <span class="original_italics">Styx;</span>
                        But Lord <br><span class="page_number">page 44</span><br> what a nomber of lurid and ugly
                        squalid countenances did I behold as I pass'd; There was one sort of torment I had
                        not seen before, ther were divers that
                        hung by their <span class="original_italics">toungs</span> upon posts up and down, I asked what they
                        were, answer was made, that they were <span class="original_italics">prick-ear'd Preachmen,
                           Iudges,</span> and <span class="original_italics">Lawyers,</span> who against their knowledg as well as
                        against their consciences, did seduce the ignorant peeple of
                        <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gheriona</span><span class="decypher d-none">England</span></span> and <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Carboncia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Scotland</span>,</span> and incite them to war; And
                        ther was a new tenter-hook provided for one <span class="original_italics">gran Villain,</span> who
                        pronounced Sentence of death against his own Soverain Prince, whose
                        <span class="original_italics">Subject</span> he was, and whom by a sacred Oath of
                        <span class="original_italics">Allegiance</span> he was tyed to obey. <br> A little further I might see multitudes of Com mittee-men and others,
                        slopping up drops of <span class="original_italics">molten lead</span> in lieu of <span class="original_italics">French
                           Barly-broth,</span> with a rabble of <span class="original_italics"> Ap prentices </span> sweeping the
                        gutters of Hell, with brooms tufted with ugly Adders and Snakes, because
                        they running into the Wars and leaving their <span class="original_italics">wares,</span> had therby
                        broke their Indentures with their Masters, and their Oaths of
                        <span class="original_italics">Allegiance</span> to their lawfull Prince. <br> Passing then along towards the Ferry, a world of hideous shapes presented
                        themselfs unto my sight; There I saw corroding cares, pannick fears, pining
                        griefs, ugly rebellion, revengefull malice, snaky discord, oppression, tyranny, disobedience,
                        perjury,
                        sacriledge, and <span class="original_italics">spirituall pride</span> (the sin that first peepled Hell)
                        put to exquisit torments; Couches of Toads, Scorpions, Asps, and Serpents
                        were in a corner hard by; I asked for whom they were prepared, I was
                        answered, for som <span class="original_italics">Evangelizing <span class="cypher">Gherionian</span><span class="decypher d-none">English</span></span> Ladies, which did egg on
                        their husbands to War; So having as I thought by a miraculous providence
                        charm'd three-headed <span class="original_italics">Cerberus,</span> by pointing at him with the signe of
                        the <span class="original_italics">Crosse</span> upon my fingers, we passed quietly by to the Ferry,
                        where being com I found tru what <span class="original_italics">Pluto</span> had said before, that ther
                        were divers <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Gherionian</span><span class="decypher d-none">English</span></span> Tarpalins entertain'd by <span class="original_italics">Charon,</span>
                        but they were in most cruell tortures, for their bodies were covered all
                        over very thick and close with canvases pitch'd and <br><span class="page_number">page 45</span><br> tarr'd, which continually burnt and flam'd round
                        about them. <br> Herewith I got awake again about the dawning of the day, and it was high
                        time to do so; <span class="w3-panel"></span><br> I say, that having after such a long noctivagation, and variety of horrid
                        visions, return'd to my perfect expergefaction, I began by a serious
                        recollection of my self to recall to my thoughts by way of reminiscence those dismall
                        and dreadfull objects that
                        had appeerd unto me, for though I was in <span class="original_italics">Hell,</span> yet I did not taste
                        of <span class="original_italics">Lethe</span> all the while, insomuch that I did not forget any thing
                        which I had seen; All the said objects presented themselfs unto me so reall,
                        that if I had bin transported with that opinion wherof many great Clerks
                        have bin, <span class="original_italics">viz.</span> That Devills are nothing els but the ill affections,
                        the exorbitant passions and <br><span class="page_number">page 46</span><br> perturbances of
                        the minde; I say, if I had bin plac'd in such an opinion, this trance wold
                        have convinc'd me; You may easily imagin what apprehensions of horror these
                        Apparitions left in my brain behind them, just as a River when by an
                        inundation she hath swel'd out of her wonted channell, doth use to leave
                        along the neighbouring medowes seggs and other weeds with much riffraff
                        stuff behind her upon her return to her former bed; so did this Vision after
                        that deluge of objects wherwith my brain was overwhelm'd for the time, leave
                        behind them black sudds, and many a ghastly thought within me, which after
                        some ruminations wrought in me a perfect change and detestation of those
                        mimicall giddy opinions wherwith I was carried away before, but while I
                        delayed the time of declaring my self that way, I was suddenly surprized,
                        and justly transmuted to this shape and species. <br></p>

                        Frenzy, which in time grew Hepticall, and so threatned a dissolution of the
                        whole frame of the body. <br> 'Tis to be feard that the same fate attends the <span class="original_italics"> Politicall </span> body of your Nation as did the
                        <span class="original_italics">Naturall</span> I spoke of; But matters may mend, and as you began to
                        find a Reformation in your self before you were trans muted to this shape, so the
                        whole Nation may come
                        to their old temper again; Therfore you shal do well, now that you are
                        invited by so pregnant an opportunity, and so reall a proffer, to shake off
                        that Apish or Monky-fac'd figure you now wear, and resume the noble erect
                        shape of Man, to look towards Heven, and be safely transported to the bosom
                        of your own dear Country, where you may by your advantageous holy
                        profession, do a great deal of good offices to your deluded Compatriots, by the contribution
                        of your
                        endeavours and talent, to reduce them to their right wits again, and so to
                        the temper of their famous progenitors. <br></p>

                        so far detest <span class="original_italics">human kind,</span> that, in the mind I am in, I had rather

                        <h6 class="speaker">Morphandra.<br></h6> IT seems, most princely <span class="original_italics">Pererius,</span> by that clowd I perceive waving
                        in your countenance, that you cannot prevail with any of those transformed
                        cretures with whom you have hitherto conferrd, to comply with your so
                        laudable desires of wearing again the shapes of <span class="original_italics">Men;</span> Therfore I
                        wold wish you to try a con clusion upon a <span class="original_italics">Female,</span> which sex useth
                        to be more soft and pliable, and ther is one just before you, That love ly
                        <span class="original_italics">white Hinde</span> (though she hath som black spots about her shingle)
                        which I see browsing upon that hedge, she was once a <span class="original_italics">Woman,</span>
                        therfore try what you can do upon her. <br></p>

                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> Madame, By treating with this last Animal, I find the old Adage confirmd,

                        nature; But, most <span class="original_italics">sagacious</span> Queen, though <span class="original_italics">Truth,</span> as the
                        proverb runs, <span class="original_italics">begets hatred oftentimes in the minds of those to whom it
                           is spoken,</span> yet, knowing well that noble spirits do disdain to have
                        one thing in the <span class="original_italics">mouth,</span> and another in the <span class="original_italics">heart,</span> I will
                        take the boldnesse to make <br><span class="page_number">page 52</span><br> a free discovery
                        of my mind, though I fear to incur therby your disfavor. <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Morphandra.<br></h6> Sir, you may frankly speak what you please, for ther is no greter a friend

                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> I doubt, though you have vouchsafed the gift of <span class="original_italics">Ratiotination</span> to
                        those Animals I have tampered withall, yet you have not bin pleased to give
                        them the full faculty of <span class="original_italics">Reson,</span> in regard I have found them so
                        averse to re-assume their first <span class="original_italics">beeing</span> from that of Beasts, which
                        could not surely be if they had the full power of their former
                        <span class="original_italics">Intellect.</span><br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Morphandra.<br></h6> Truly if I had don so, you might have justly thought your self to have been
                        deluded by me, and that I had don you but half a courtesie or a fained
                        promise; Now touching promises a noble mind shold not make any, that he hath
                        not the <span class="original_italics">wil</span> to do, or the <span class="original_italics">power</span> to perform, for the one
                        proceeds from pure <span class="original_italics">dissimulation,</span> and the o ther from meer
                        <span class="original_italics">foolishnes:</span> But know, that all that intervall of time you have held a parly with those
                        transmuted Animals you have tried already, they had the same reach and full
                        light of <span class="original_italics">Reson</span> as they had when they were Men. <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> Oh, how is it possible then that the eyes of their understanding shold not be opend,
                        to discern their
                        own error? <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Morphandra.<br></h6> It may well be that they find and feel more con tentment, and sweetnes in
                        that life they now lead, wherof men have no sense or knowledg, therfore 'tis
                        no thing of wonder that they desire to continue so; But go and poursue the
                        point of your enterprise, for it may be you may find som other that will be
                        conformable to your counsell herein, and 'tis very probable that Hinde may
                        do it. <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> 'Tis observed by wise men, that they who can pre scribe <br><span class="page_number">page 53</span><br> a way of themselfs to live contentedly and well,
                        are to be plac'd in the first degree of vertu; And they which cannot do it
                        of themselfs, but are content to be directed by the counsell of wiser men,
                        are to be plac'd in the second degree; But they who are not capable to
                        counsell themselfs, nor receive counsell from others, are not worthy to be
                        rank'd in the nomber of <span class="original_italics">Rational</span> cretures; Of this last kind those
                        silly Animals are with whom I have held discours, therfore 'tis no marvail
                        that my perswasions could not take place with them; But knowing it to be the
                        greatest part of humanity for one to commiserat and help another, I will
                        push on my endeavours in this point, and see what I can do with that lovely
                        <span class="original_italics">white Hinde,</span> for that sex whereof she was formerly useth to be
                        more tender, and to take impressions more easily: Gentle creture, I come to
                        be the messenger of good tydings unto you. <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Hinde.<br></h6> O! may Heven be blessed, I understand the accents of Man, and have the
                        strings of my toung loosned to <span class="original_italics">talk</span> again. <br></p>

                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> I hope now to have met with one fit for my purpose, for I hear her thank
                        Heven that she is come again to the gift of speech: Give me leave to ask
                        you, gentle <span class="original_italics">Hinde,</span> how came you to be thus so strangely transfigured? <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Hinde.<br></h6> It was the great Queen <span class="original_italics">Morphandra</span> who hath put this shape upon me;
                        But, Sir, give me leave to return you a question, Wherfore are you so
                        desirous to know the cause of my transmutation? for I was never ask'd the reson ever
                        since by any, nor had I
                        my speech return'd unto me till now, ever since I went upon four leggs. <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> The reson that I desire to know the cause of your transfiguration is for
                        your infinit advantage, as you shall find, therfore I pray dispence with my
                        curiosity, <br><span class="page_number">page 54</span><br> if I desire to know further what
                        country and condition you were of when you were a <span class="original_italics">Rational</span> creture.
                        <br></p>

                        <h6 class="speaker">Hinde.<br></h6> Sir, I was born in <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Marcopolis</span><span class="decypher d-none">Venice</span></span> that rare <span class="original_italics">Maiden</span> City, so
                        much renowned throughout the world for the strangenes of her scituation, for
                        her policy, riches, and power; But though she continu still a
                        <span class="original_italics">Virgin,</span> yet she is married once every year to <span class="original_italics">Neptune</span>
                        whose minion she is, which makes her accounted so salacious; There I had my
                        first birth, and was accounted one of the Beauties of my time, till for som
                        dissolut courses and wildnes of youth, it pleased <span class="original_italics">Morphandra</span> to
                        give me a second kind of generation, and transmute me to this shape you
                        behold. <br></p>

                        bin pleased to promise me that she will re-invest you in you former fair nature if
                        you desire it, therfore I

                        women are observ'd to be the best, in regard that the more you think on a
                        thing, the more your thoughts use to be intangled; Therfore tell me whether
                        you will be a woman again, I or no? <br></p>

                        vilified by you, that som of your Philosophers (or Foolosophers more

                        with men, and if we were, <br><span class="page_number">page 55</span><br> yet it was by an

                        design is still meant for <span class="original_italics">man,</span> and that a female is a thing brought
                        into the world beyond Nature's intention, either by the imperfection of
                        seed, or some other defect; Which absurd opinion how contrary it is to the
                        just order of nature, is manifest to any one that hath but a crum of wit,
                        considering how we also concur to your generation, though som of your old
                        doting Wisards have held the contrary, holding us to be meerly passive in

                        of the Soul's residence, we may compare the Soul to an Empresse, wisely
                        restraining or giving freedom to the misguided affections, according <br><span class="page_number">page 81</span><br> to the exact rules of Reson; Here we have
                        Man ruling in Man, dressing and manuring Man as another Paradise, wherin is

                        most admirable harmony of all things in the whole Universe of Man;
                        <span class="original_italics">Reson</span> is that Diadem wherby the soul doth rule and regulat the
                        will, and the affections, the Chancellor which doth moderat the motions of
                        both; <span class="original_italics">Reson</span> is that Rod wherwith the Soul is kept in awe to obey,
                        without any servile fear, her Creator and chiefest Good; By <span class="original_italics">Reson</span>
                        the Soul discerns ther is a God, deducing arguments from the Creation of the
                        fair fabric of the world, which had either existence from it self, or was
                        pro duced by another; but it could not give a first beeing to it self, in
                        regard 'tis repugnant to the principles of Nature, that any thing should be
                        the cause of it self; Therfore the Inference is undeniable, that the world
                        was made by another which was pre-existent, and such another that was the
                        Efficient cause therof, not produced by any other former efficient cause,
                        but was of Himself, and by Himself from eternity, which can be no other than
                        God; Another argument the Soul drawes from the necessary dependance of a
                        finit Beeing upon an Infinit, for all created natures are finit, both in
                        respect of their essence, and operations; Now, every thing that is finit
                        must necessarily be limited by another, seeing it is impossible that any
                        thing shold give bounds to it self; And ther being not in things finit a
                        progresse to Infinity, We must at length come to some certain Independent
                        Beeing, which is not circumscrib'd or limited by another, but is of it self
                        essentially and virtually infinit, which can be no other than God Almighty;
                        A third argument is drawn from the necessary dependance of a
                        <span class="original_italics">Secondary</span> cause upon a <span class="original_italics">First,</span> for unlesse we do here
                        also grant a progresse to Infinity, which is absurd in mounting up the scale
                        of subordination of causes, we must at length meet with one primary both
                        Efficient and Finall <br><span class="page_number">page 82</span><br> cause, that hath no
                        other cause superiour or precedent unto it, which is onely God: Another
                        argument the Soul draweth, still by the ministry of <span class="original_italics">Reson,</span> to prove
                        a Deity, is the constant cours of the Starrs, those glorious Luminaries, and
                        the continued order of all things else in their first station, through all
                        the vicissitudes of corruption and generation, which doth forcibly intimat
                        an ubiquitary Providence, a wise Rector, Governor, and Commander, upon whose
                        di rection all things depend; No sooner doth the Soul by such reaches of
                        Reson throughly satisfie her self that ther is a God, but she mounts yet
                        higher, endeavouring to know what God is; But such is the transcendent
                        refulgence of his Majesty, that she finds it impossible to look God in the
                        face, or to know him <span class="original_italics">à priori;</span> yet though she is not able to behold
                        his face, yet she hath leave granted to know him <span class="original_italics">à posteriori,</span>
                        though she cannot <span class="original_italics">define</span> the incomprehensible Deity, yet she may
                        still, guided by light of Reson, <span class="original_italics">describe</span> him by an aggregation of
                        Attributes? To know God by his Attributes is a near approach to his Deity;
                        Yet the Rationall soul goes still nearer, first prying into his Essence,
                        then returning to her self, and contriving which way she should know more,
                        at length she says within her self, <span class="original_italics">Operatio sequitur Esse,</span> Action
                        follows its Being; Then she busies her self in the contemplation of Gods
                        <span class="original_italics">Actions,</span> which she finds either <span class="original_italics">immanent</span> and inward,
                        or <span class="original_italics">transient</span> and outward; The <span class="original_italics">immanent</span> actions of God are
                        such as are performed intrinsecally within Himself, without any externall
                        respect to the creture, wherby he is said to contemplat, to know, and love
                        Himself; Here the Soul takes notice of a reflection of the Deity upon it
                        self, and so is heightned to the supposition of a <span class="original_italics">Trinity,</span> the
                        cardinall and abstrusest point, the highest pitch she can soar unto; She
                        proceeds to argue, that wheras God doth conceive and know Himself, he doth
                        beget a perfect Image of Himself, from which issueth a perfect Love of
                        Himself, and a complacency; Now, seeing ther is nothing in God which is not
                        God, both the <br><span class="page_number">page 83</span><br> Image of God, and the Love of
                        God seem to be distinct Subsistences of the same Essence with Him from whom
                        they proceed, as when an Eye doth see it self, ther is first the Eye seeing,
                        secondly, the Eye seen, or at least the Image of the eye seen, from which
                        acti on of seeing her arises a desire of enjoyment; This comparison doth in
                        some sort adumbrat the <span class="original_italics">blessed Trinity;</span> First, ther is the Eye;
                        Secondly, ther is a Re flection or Image of the Eye; Thirdly, ther is a love

                        fertility, let me tell you, that to my knowledg ther be divers parts of her
                        so barren and desolat, that you shall not meet with a house in twenty miles riding;
                        <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Rugilia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Genoa</span>,</span> that part

                        Rocks and Craggs; In som places you
                        may see three Marquisses on one tree gathering Figgs to keep them from
                        starving: They bragg of a River that hath Junkets in her, som Comfits, some
                        Plumms, som Cinnamon, but these Junkets are but white stones <br><span class="page_number">page 90</span><br> bearing the shape of all these; Ther's no Country
                        hath more <span class="original_italics">Tempests,</span> more Tremblings and Earthquakes, wherof ther
                        have been very lately such formidable examples of utter desolation and
                        subversion of twenty Towns; There is part of the Country which is under a
                        perpetual shadowy darknesse or <span class="original_italics">adumbration,</span> whence the whole
                        Province takes its denomination; Ther's no Clime under the convex of Heven
                        where Meteors and fulgurations are more impetuous and violent. <br> Touching the second, which was my former <span class="original_italics"> Condition, </span> ther's a
                        thing called <span class="original_italics">Conscience</span> which us'd to tyrannize and torture me when
                        I was a <span class="original_italics">Man,</span> I often found within me a gnawing worm, I often felt
                        sore stings, sore pricks, and remorses of the said Consci ence, which the
                        Theologues call <span class="original_italics">Synteresis,</span> that ever and anon did discompose the
                        quietude of my thoughts, and disturb me in my gaining profession; But in
                        this state I am free from such perplexities, for now, though I suck the
                        blood of twenty Geese a day, and destroy whole roosts of Hens, the thing
                        call'd <span class="original_italics"> Conscience </span> never troubles me. Moreover, besides this rack
                        of Conscience, ther is a vice call'd <span class="original_italics">Covetousnes</span> that <span class="original_italics">Man</span>
                        is subject unto, and when all other vices grow old in him, this vice growes
                        younger and younger. I remember I was slavishly addicted hereunto, I would
                        have flayed a louse could I have made benefit of her skin, but now I am free
                        from that fordid vice, from that kind of idolatry, for according to the
                        saying, he is the worse Idolater who adores Gold, for he may be said therby
                        to worship the Devil, for <span class="original_italics">Pluto</span> is the god of Riches; In the shape
                        I bear, I covet no more but what wil satisfie nature only: Ther is another
                        cursed and cruciatory humor call'd <span class="original_italics"> Iealousie </span> which much afflicts
                        Mankind, and it reigns more amongst that Nation I was once of than among any
                        other; Jealousie among the thoughts is like Batts among birds, it doth
                        mightily discompose the whole inward man, and disturb the tranquillity of
                        his mind, nay it hurls him often upon desperat and bloody attempts. <br><br><span class="page_number">page 91</span><br> Touching the third, which is
                        <span class="original_italics">Company,</span> I have now far better, conversing with these innocuous
                        and simple Animals. The society of men is much more dangerous, specially of
                        my quondam <span class="original_italics">Country-men,</span> for upon any occasion of distast one is in
                        danger of a <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Saturnian</span><span class="decypher d-none">Italian</span></span> Figg, or to be poyson'd by the smoak of a
                        candle, by the suavity of a flower, or by a glove or handkerchief; For four
                        or five Duckets reward, one may be master of any man's life in som places of
                        <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Saturnia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Italy</span>,</span> for he will find a mercenary instrument to murther
                        any body; Add hereunto, that my Country-men are full of revenge, and vindicatif in
                        the highest degree, they
                        will seldom suffer one to do them a second wrong, but dispatch him away to
                        the other world, which is the occasion of a saying, <span class="original_italics">Take heed of a slow
                           Foe in <span class="cypher">Saturnia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Italy</span>, and of a sudden Friend in <span class="cypher">Artonia</span><span class="decypher d-none">France</span>;</span> I could give
                        you many examples hereof, but I will produce onely two; In
                        <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Marcopolis</span><span class="decypher d-none">Venice</span>,</span> the greatest <span class="original_italics">Mart</span> of the Western world,
                        (though two of her chiefest be but <span class="original_italics">brittle</span> Commodities, <span class="original_italics">viz. Lasses</span> and <span class="original_italics">Glasses</span> )
                        ther were two rich Merchants who had been partners a long time, it chanced
                        that one of them knowing the other to be over familiar with his wife, he
                        dissembled his passion a great while, till his thoughts had contriv'd and
                        concluded a revenge upon him, so he solemnly invi ted his partner to a
                        Feast, and after dinner he led him to a Garden that he had by the Sea-side,
                        being there alone together he brought him to an Arbor, where among divers
                        other rarities ther was a curious new large Chari made with such artifice,
                        that when one had put himself to sit in it, ther were certain gins and vices
                        wold suddenly rise up and clasp in his body both arms and thighs; His
                        Partner being thus lockt fast in the Chair, he presently gaggs him, and
                        having lockt the Garden dore, he drew a great double-edg'd knife, and being
                        upon the point of stabbing him, the Partner said, Oh be not so inhuman and
                        barbarously cruell as to kill me before confession, therfore have som
                        commiseration on my soul; Well, replied the murtherer, if thou wilt do one
                        thing, I may spare thee thy life, <br><span class="page_number">page 92</span><br> which is,
                        If thou wilt defie the holy Trinity, and renounce all hopes of salvation in
                        it, &amp;c. The Partner (in hopes of future repentance to expiat his
                        offence) repeated those words three times, and the third time as soon as he
                        had done repeating them, he stabb'd him in the breast, and cleft his heart
                        in two, and so threw his body into the Sea to make food for Hadocks; But a
                        while after his body being retreev'd and taken up in a fisher-net just under
                        that wall, the murther was discover'd, and the murtherer being put upon the
                        Strapado he confessed all, and going up the Gibbe to be executed, he broke
                        out into a great fit of laughter; His ghostly Father and Confessor telling
                        him, that he was now going to give account of that horrid murther he had
                        committed before the great Judge of the world, therfore that passion of
                        laughter did not be com him; Oh, said he, whensoever I think upon that full
                        revenge I had of that villain, my heart danceth within me for joy, for <span class="original_italics">I
                           was not onely reveng'd upon his body but also upon his soul,</span> in
                        which humor he breath'd his last. <br> Another was as bloody, if not more; In the antient City of <span class="original_italics">Cerano,</span>
                        ther was a Prince who left three sons behind him, <span class="original_italics">Conradus, Caesar,</span>
                        and <span class="original_italics">Alexander; Conradus</span> was us'd to come from his palace in the
                        Country to his Castle in <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Cerano</span><span class="decypher d-none">Nocera</span>,</span> where he had appointed a Governour, and a Garrison of souldiers; The
                        Governor having a comly Lady to his wife, the young Prince was struck in
                        love with her, and at last enjoyed her; The Governour having knowledge
                        therof did meditat upon a revenge, therupon he sent to <span class="original_italics">Conradus</span>
                        (his Lord and Master) that he had lately discover'd two or three wild
                        <span class="original_italics">Boars</span> in the Forest of <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Cerano</span><span class="decypher d-none">Nocera</span>,</span> therfore if his Highnesse would please to com thither
                        together with his two brothers, ther wold be very Princely sport for them,
                        and he wold prepare all things ready for the Game; Hereupon the young Prince
                        and his second Brother comming thither expresly for that sport, it chanced
                        that <span class="original_italics">Alexander</span> the youngest brother was then out of the way; So the
                        Governor <br><span class="page_number">page 93</span><br> of the Castle having provided a
                        plentifull supper for the two Princes and their Retinue, being both gone to
                        bed, he calls his Officers together, and told them, Gentlemen, what does he
                        deserve, who for many good services and hospitalities done unto him, doth in
                        lieu of thanks abuse ones wife, and defiles his bed? They all cried out, He
                        deserves death; Truly Gentlemen, thus hath Prince <span class="original_italics">Conradus</span> us'd me;
                        They cried out again, Let him die, and we will stick unto you, and be
                        faithfull; So the Governor taking som of those Officers with him in the dead
                        of night, they broke suddenly into the chamber where <span class="original_italics">Conradus</span> was
                        asleep, and heaving up the bed-cloaths, they first cut off his
                        privy-members, then they chop'd off his head, then they quarter'd his body,
                        and strewed them up and down the chamber; So all was hush'd that night;
                        Prince <span class="original_italics">Caesar</span> comming to wait on his Brother the next morning, the
                        Governor usher'd him in, and seeing his Brother's head bleeding on the
                        window, and his limbs scatter'd up and down the room, he said, Oh! is this
                        the wild Boar you writ to him of? Yes, said the Governour, and I remember I
                        writ of two or three; Hereupon he was also knock'd down, and us'd in the
                        same manner? The Tragedy being acted thus far, he takes his Officers, and
                        going upon the Castle walls, he sent to speak with the Syndic and Burgesses
                        of the Town, unto whom he made a Speech, that they had been a long time in
                        servitude or a kind of slavery to <span class="original_italics">Conradus</span> and that Family, and now
                        ther was a fair opportunity offered for them to redeem their liberties, for
                        he had <span class="original_italics">Conradus</span> and his Brother in his custody, and the Officers
                        with the rest of the Garrison were inclin'd to do them away, if the Town
                        wold joyn with them; But the Town shewing an aversnes, or rather a
                        detestation of such disloyalty and treason, sent to Prince
                        <span class="original_italics">Alexander</span> the youngest Brother, and the Citizens of
                        <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Cerano</span><span class="decypher d-none">Nocera</span></span> joyning with the forces he brought with him to expiat
                        his Brother's bloods, they beleaguer the Castle round; Therupon the Governor
                        taking his wife and children with him <br><span class="page_number">page 94</span><br> to
                        the top of the highest Turret, he first threw down headlong his wife, then
                        his three children, and last of all he precipitates himself, and so the
                        Tragedy ended. <br></p>

                        rid luring after her, and retreeved her in the Orchard where the Marquis
                        himself was entred, having obtain'd leave before; The Hawk being found, the
                        Merchant invites the Marquis to a Treatment, where his wife was present, and
                        very officious to please; Being de parted, she asks her husband who he was?
                        He an swer'd, 'Tis the Marquis of such a place, one of the gallantest and
                        most hopefull young Noblemen in all <span class="original_italics"><span class="cypher">Saturnia</span><span class="decypher d-none">Italy</span>,</span> a person full of
                        transcendent parts and high perfections, &amp;c. These praises making deep
                        impressions in his wife, and the Marquis poursuing still his design, he at
                        last prevailed, and being admitted to her chamber by a back Garden-dore, he
                        found her a bed, and in a fit posture to receive him; so unbracing himself
                        to go to her, and having put off his doublet, she told him smilingly, Do you
                        know whom you may <br><span class="page_number">page 95</span><br> thank most for this
                        courtesie? It is my husband, who after the late Treatment you had, fell a
                        long time into such high commendations of you, that I never heard him speak
                        so nobly of any: The Marquis being put to a sudden stand hereby, and struck
                        with a kind of astonishment, put on his doublet again and his cloak, saying,
                        Shall I abuse so worthy a friend, and such noble affections? No, I will die
                        first; So taking his leave of the Lady in civill and thankfull posture, he
                        departed the same way he was let in, and never attempted her again. <br></p>

                        Almighty the Author of all Rebellions and Sedition: As was lately practised

                        able to constitute a lasting durable Government, or settle a firm and

                        Government which hath a nearer analogy with that of Heven, that is more
                        lasting upon earth, that is more regular, or that hath any certain

                        Philosophers, <span class="original_italics">Aristotle,</span> in his Politiques, upon which ther is such
                        a world of Comments, speaks of sundry species of Governments, as

                        but he puts no Rules for any, onely he hath this assertion, that
                        <span class="original_italics">Aristocracy</span> or <span class="original_italics">Optimacy</span> allows no <span class="original_italics"> Artificer or

                        of the first Founders of Common-wealths, then he proceeds to correct the
                        errors of Common-wealths, before he tells us what a Common-wealth is; Moreover, in
                        handling the kinds of
                        Government in generall, he flies forward and back ward in a disorderly way,
                        but when he descends to particular forms, he is full, not onely of
                        confusion, but contradictions and inconstancies to himself; In som places he
                        seems to deny any naturall <span class="original_italics">Right,</span> much more any <span class="original_italics">Majesty</span> to
                        be in the <span class="original_italics">People,</span> whom <span class="original_italics">he holds to be little inferiour to
                           Beasts;</span> Wheras else-where he af fordeth a liberty to every City to
                        set up what Government they please, either by Force or Craft, which in
                        effect is to allow the Peeple to do what they list, if they be able. Now
                        this high-reaching Philosopher cannot much be censured for roving up and
                        down in so incertain a subject, it being impossible for any hu man brain to
                        prescribe any infallible universall Rules for Government, that may quadrat
                        with the nature of all Climes and Seasons, and be appliable to the humors of
                        all Peeple; Other Sciences have Demonstrations, and undeniable Principles,
                        but the Art of Government hath no such Maxims, in regard of a thousand sort
                        of contingencies that attend human negotiations, as also for the various
                        dispositions of peeple, som Nations are so fiery mouth'd, that they must be

                        with such, such that while they take upon them to give Precepts for Government, they
                        amuse the Reader with Universalls,
                        (and commonly ther is deceit in Universalls) or ra ther they lead him to a
                        labyrinth of distinctions, wherby they render the Art of mastring Man to be
                        more difficult and distracted, then it is in its own nature; But, under
                        favour, the main cause that ther are such difficulties and incertitudes in
                        prescribing gene rall Rules to govern the Human Creture, is the perturbances
                        of his mind, his variety of humors, his seditious disposition, his

                        extend to the whole masse of Mankind in point of Government; One is, That
                        the common peeple be kept still in such an awe, that they may not have any
                        power to rise up in Arms, or be sharers in the Government, and so be their
                        own Caterers to chuse what Laws they please; Secondly, That ther be a
                        visible standing effectif military strength still in being, to keep them in
                        such an awe, as well to <span class="original_italics">curb</span> them as to <span class="original_italics">conserve</span> them; It
                        being the greatest Soloecism that can be in Government to rely meerly upon
                        the affections of the <span class="original_italics">Peeple,</span> in regard there is not such a
                        wavering windy thing, not such an humorsom crosse-grain'd Animal as the
                        common Peeple, ther is not such a Tyrant in the world if once he get on
                        Horse-back; And all Authors that have pretended any thing to policy, either
                        old or new, affirm so much in their Writings; If the Governour in chief hath
                        not such a constant visible Power, and moveable upon all occasions, the
                        common Peeple will use him as the Froggs in the Fable us'd the Logg of wood

                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> Madame, I shall most willingly comply with your commands herein; Touching
                        the Sympatheticall Powder or Medicine it self, It is made of a Zaphyrian
                        azurd salt, calcind by <span class="original_italics">Solar</span> fire into a <span class="original_italics">Lunar</span> complexion,
                        operating principally when the Sun is in the two celestiall Signes of
                        <span class="original_italics">Leo</span> and <span class="original_italics">Cancer;</span> But, Madame, before I can make the
                        thing truly understood, I must lay down som universall Laws or Maxims of
                        nature; First, it is tru without controul, that all actions and motions are
                        performed by Atoms or small invisible bodies, moving to and fro after a
                        different manner proportionable to their severall figures, all naturall
                        things operat thus, and not by I know not what Qualities or Accidents, which
                        have onely a notionall subsistence, and no reall being but as they inhaere
                        in the substance; Secondly, ther is a perpetuall constant expiration of such <span class="original_italics">Atoms</span> from all naturall bodies, caus'd
                        by a compression of other circumambient and neighbouring bodies, driving the
                        parts closer to gether, or else by the motion of other <span class="original_italics">Atoms</span>
                        crowding into the foraminous parts of that body, interrupting as it were the
                        quietude of the former inmates, and thrusting them out to wander in the air
                        till they meet with som other body where they may get rest; This effluvium
                        or emanation of <span class="original_italics">Atoms</span> by help of autopticall Glasses, have bin
                        sensibly discerned to flow from the Load-stone and other bodies, whose pores
                        are more plentifull, in form of a kind of mist; In bodies that are actually
                        hot this atomicall expiration is sensibly perceptible by the smell,
                        specially to cretures of an acuter sense, for the Atoms hovering in the
                        circumambient air, or upon the ground, are sure guides to the Grey-hound
                        while he poursues the Chace, as if the hunted creture were continually in
                        his sight; These expiring Atoms are also as sensibly discover'd by weight,
                        it being experimentally found, that those <span class="original_italics">Iockies</span> who use to run
                        Horse-races can make them selfs lighter by many pounds weight in a day or
                        two, <br><span class="page_number">page 104</span><br> which proceeds by this insensible
                        emission of Atoms; Secondly, it is to be observ'd, that these atomicall
                        bodies are not of one figure, nor of one grossnesse or magnitude, som being
                        so slender and subtle that they admit of no opposition, but continu their
                        course through all Mediums, and whatever may be seen to stop them in their
                        journey cannot be discerned but by their effects, such are the contagious
                        Atoms of bodies infected with the Pest, or other taking-diseases, which are
                        not onely imparted to others by lurking in the Visitant's cloths, but being
                        scattered in the air are transported to remote places and persons, on whom
                        they exercise their tyranny, not discover'd till they break out into open
                        violence; Other Atoms are grosser, and cannot so easily passe by, but are
                        driven back, and forced from their intended voyage, and somtimes driven into
                        the pory parts of other bodies against their wills; Such Atoms are
                        apprehended by our senses, as heat, cold, color, smells, putrefactions,
                        &amp;c. which use to move more slowly than others; Som are so corpulent and
                        strong that they remove fix'd and solid bodies out of their stations, as the
                        <span class="original_italics">Wind,</span> and many others, that are driven to and fro by the
                        impetuosity therof, and forced therby to change their places; These Atoms
                        are in a manner so palpable, that we must needs confesse their reall Beeing
                        and activity; Thirdly, it is another undeniable truth, that all bodies
                        desire rest, and wold still dwell in their own proper stations if they were
                        not ejected by an intruder, for <span class="original_italics">Rest</span> is the appetite of all
                        naturall bodies, because 'tis the mother of union; Now, ther are som places
                        more fit than others for the receiving and retaining of the said Atoms,
                        wherin they may lodg more conveniently, and acquiesce a longer time, this
                        proceeds from the fashion and form of the pores wherin they are intromitted,
                        which are proportionable and more agreeing with the figures of the Atoms
                        which are of divers shapes, for som are angular, som cylindricall, som are
                        branch'd, som smooth, others are sharp and rough; Ther are in most bodies
                        <br><span class="page_number">page 105</span><br> pores agreeable to these various
                        figures, insomuch that every naturall body is apt and ready to admit such
                        Atoms that are cognate and proportionable to their pores, and to exclude
                        others; Now no Atoms acquiesce any where but in such proportionat pores,
                        they may be driven into other bodies, or they may accompany other Atoms into
                        pores that do not exactly quadrat with their figures, but cannot take any
                        long repose there, being still extruded by those that do better fill the place, and
                        correspond with the
                        capacity and proportion of those pores, whence ariseth a naturall propension and tendency
                        towards those
                        bodies where such pores are found; Nor can those Atoms which are not sutable
                        to the pores wherein they are, stay there quietly, but they are still
                        dislodg'd and sholder'd out, or pressed to give room to those Atoms whose
                        figures challenge a right to those pores; Inso much that it may be said,
                        ther is a kind of perpetuall warr 'twixt those Atoms that are proportionat
                        and proper to the pores they are lodg'd in, and those which usurp them; For
                        to have perfect rest in a place, and to claim a naturall right unto it, ther
                        must be a cognation 'twixt the atom and the pore which may be call'd
                        <span class="original_italics">Sympathy,</span> such as are all magneticall and at tractive motions;
                        Fourthly, no distance hinders the motion of these Atoms towards their
                        naturall cognate places, towards which they are perpetually travelling, and
                        the nearer they approach to their desired home, the swifter their motion is,
                        and the lesse resistance they find in their journey. <br> These prolegomena or generall notions being pre mis'd, I com now to the
                        operative vertue of the <span class="original_italics"> Sym patheticall Powder, </span> which, as I
                        describ'd it before, is made of a Zaphyrian salt, calcind by a celestiall

                        complexion (as the learned Doctor <span class="original_italics">H.</span> hath it, who discourseth like
                        a tru Phoilosopher of these notions) The heat here of must be such, that it
                        may draw out all adventitious moystur, leaving it intensly dry, and in this
                        condition it must be kept, for if it chance to meet with any humidity it <br><span class="page_number">page 106</span><br> loseth its energy, and must to the
                        aetnereall furnace again; It must be also but a competent heat, for by excesse of
                        heat all the volatile parts and finest
                        atoms which onely work the cure, will be evaporated, and onely the grosser
                        saline parts remain, which neither can be rays'd to accompany the atoms of
                        the extravenated blood, nor if they could wold they cure, but by their
                        sharper angles grate the orifices of the capilla ry veins, and so procure an
                        efflux of blood, and not a consolidation of the wound. <br></p>

                        <h6 class="speaker">Morphandra.<br></h6> Noble Prince, these are high Philosophicall Noti ons that you discourse of,
                        but now that you have spo ken of the substance of this rare Medicament, how
                        must it be apply'd? <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> The manner of applying it is in this manner, The blood or bloody matter
                        being taken from the wound on a cloth, or remaining still on the wounding
                        instrument, must be lightly covered over with this powder, kept very dry,
                        and afterwards wrapp'd up close from the air, and so preserved in a temperat
                        heat, it must also be kept clean, and clos'd up with neat linnen to fence it
                        from cold, for cold hinders the expiration and breathing forth of the
                        balsamicall Atoms, which shold drain forth the superfluous humidity, and
                        restrain the efflux of blood; Now, the greatest rarenes of this
                        <span class="original_italics">Sympatheticall Powder</span> is, that by a <span class="original_italics"> virtuall contact </span>
                        it heals at a distance by the intercourse of the Atoms proceeding from the
                        extravenated blood of the Patient, which Atoms like so many little spirits
                        glide through the aire, and never rest till they come to their desired home,
                        where being gladly entertained, they find an easie entrance at the cognate
                        parts, and proportionat pores of the wound; Being admitted there they fall
                        to work, and first, they dilate the superfluous humid parts, and make them
                        fit to be expell'd, then by their more then ordinary restrictive power they
                        shrinck together the pores, and squeezing out that noxious corrupt humidity,
                        glew together the disunited <br><span class="page_number">page 107</span><br> parts, and so
                        cicatrize and cure: And truly, Madame, I could produce diverse pregnant
                        examples of those that were healed by the atomicall energy of this
                        Sympatheticall powder, but I desire one may serve for all; Ther was a
                        knowing Captain who made often use of it, and two of his Officers having
                        drawn blood one of another in a Duell, he got their bloodied Swords and
                        applied his balsamicall Powder, so in lesse then 24 hours they were almost
                        cur'd; But the Captain understanding that their animosities were such, that
                        they were resolved to fight again, he hung the balsam'd bloodied Swords out
                        at his window all night, so comming the next morning to visit his Pa tients,
                        they told him that they were in cruell pain all night long; And so you shall
                        be still, quoth the Captain, untill you be perfect friends, for I hear that
                        you will fight again; So having made them shake hands, and perfectly
                        reconcil'd them, he cur'd both in a very short time. <br></p>

                        let this serve for all; It chanced ther was one that bore malice to a woman

                        so told him, that he and his generation had don him wrong from time to time:
                        Helas, said the <span class="original_italics">Lamb,</span> how could that be? for I am but newly com

                        meeting with the <span class="original_italics">Dolphin</span> in his way he was presently devour'd; Or

                        the tail of a <span class="original_italics">Wolf</span> be hung in the Cratch of Oxen, they cannot eat;
                        If a Horse treads in the foot-steps of a <span class="original_italics">Wolf,</span> he cleaves fast as
                        if he were frozen; Nay, if a Mare big with Foal tread in the place where a

                        <h6 class="speaker">Goat.<br></h6> What do you mean by Reson? I think the shape and species I now am in are
                        capable of <span class="original_italics">Reson,</span> for we can distinguish 'twixt good and bad,
                        'twixt what is noxious or profitable for us, we have also the same organs,

                        and the celestiall bodies pour the same influences upon us as they use to do
                        upon the human Creture. <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act">
                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> It cannot be denied but you have an <span class="original_italics">Instinct</span> that acts according to
                        Reson, and it may be call'd <span class="original_italics"> Instinctive Reson; </span> But the Reson that
                        Beasts have is limited to corporeall objects, to the necessities onely of
                        life, to find out food and shelter, and bring up their young ones, its onely
                        direct Reson that's capable of <span class="original_italics">Singulars,</span> its restrain'd to an
                        opinionative faculty, its a meer shadow of ours, much like the objects that
                        our fancy represents to us in sleep; And this Instinct in Beasts is as much
                        inferiour to Reson in Man, as Reson in man is inferiour to Intelligence and
                        Intuitions in the blessed Angells. <br></p>
                     <p class="speech-act"><br><span class="page_number">page 119</span><br><h6 class="speaker">Goat.<br></h6> Yet, Sir, it must be granted, that actions whose suc cesses are so well
                        ordered, actions which have so well regulated a progresse, and concatenation
                        so exactly tying the Mediums to the End, must needs be performed by the
                        guidance and light of tru Reson, and such actions you know sensitive
                        cretures daily per form; With what art do Birds build their nests, the Fox
                        his hole, the Badger his chamber, with what cau tion do they preserve their
                        young ones, and fence them from the injury of the Hevens? how punctually do
                        they keep their haunts? But what do you think of <span class="original_italics">Pliny</span> 's Elephant
                        repeating his Lesson at Moon-shine, or of <span class="original_italics">Ptolomey</span> 's Stagg that
                        understood Greek, of <span class="original_italics"> Plutarch </span> 's Dogg who could counterfeit the
                        very convulsions of death, of the Ape that could play at Chesse, and another
                        that had learnt som touches on the Guittern? What think you of
                        <span class="original_italics">Caligula</span> 's Horse who was made Consul? had not he Reson in him?
                        What think you of the Asse, who being us'd to carry burdens of Salt over a
                        Foord was us'd to stumble and fall constantly in such a place, that therby
                        the salt melting away into water his burden might be the lighter, but his
                        Master lading him with a tadd of Wool, he fell at his usuall place, but
                        being helped up again, and he feeling the pack of wool heavier in regard of
                        the water that got in, he never stumbled any more in the Foord after that
                        time; What think you of the Crow, that in the time of a great drowth finding
                        water in the bottom of a barrell, and being fearfull to go down, carried so
                        many stones in her beak, that letting them fall down, they forc'd the water
                        to rise upwards towards the top, and so she dranck safely and at ease? I
                        pray were not all these not onely Instin ctive but <span class="original_italics">Discoursive</span>
                        Resons? <br></p>

                        <h6 class="speaker">Pererius.<br></h6> I confesse that he who denies a kind of <span class="original_italics">Reson</span> and Resoning also to
                        brute Animals, may be questiond whether he be master of Reson himself, yet
                        this <span class="original_italics">Reson</span> and Resoning looks upon present and particular notions <br><span class="page_number">page 120</span><br> onely;
                        But human Reson extendeth to universall notions out of the reach of sense,
                        which cannot be without abstractions, and som reflections it hath on it
                        self, which Beasts cannot attain; This Reson that is conversant with
                        Universalls is the tru specificall difference 'twixt Man and Beasts; It is
                        the portion and property of Man alone, whereby he hath the Soverainty over
                        all over his fellow-cretures throughout all the Elementary World; Ther is
                        <span class="original_italics">Intuitive,</span> ther is <span class="original_italics">Discoursive,</span> and ther is

                        contemplat and discourse of generalls and things absent; And these three
                        differ in excellency as the three degrees of Comparison. <br></p>

                        many of us that surpasse you in strength and quicknesse of sense, as the

                        and the <span class="original_italics">Dogg</span> goes far beyond you in smelling, as also the
                        <span class="original_italics">Stagg,</span> therefore when he is removed from one Park to another,
                        you use to muzzle him, and carry him in close Carts that he may not smell
                        the way back again; And there be examples to admiration of this kind. <br></p>

                        of reception, yet in point of dijudication, &amp; differencing the variety
                        of smels which proceeds from the Rationall Soul, we surpasse them; Therfore
                        though we cannot see as <span class="original_italics">Eagles,</span> nor hear as <span class="original_italics">Hares,</span> nor

                        advantagious, the caus of which Erection (after the beholding of Heven) is
                        the exercise Arts, which cannot be done in another figure; Mans body is
                        likewise the most copious of organs, and though born naked, yet this
                        nakednesse cuts out work for Reson; It abounds also more with Animal spirits
                        <br><span class="page_number">page 121</span><br> and heat, it hath long feet that the

                        recompence for his frailties, nakedness and weakness, yet in som kind it it
                        may be said to be a disadvantage unto him, for it makes him subject to a
                        thousand vexations of spirit, it fills him with inquisitive thoughts and
                        scruples touching his salvation, it makes him a tyrant to himself by sundry sorts
                        of perplexities and
                        molestations of mind, for I have known it by experience, let the threed of a
                        man's life be never so well spun, yet it cannot be without bracks and
                        thrumbs: Ther is no creture so troublesome to himself as man, for as rust
                        adheres naturally to Copper, so ill affections and obliquities adhere to
                        human nature: Moreover, <span class="original_italics">you,</span> like us, are but raggs of mortality,
                        yet you are so vain in magnifying your own species, that you make Man the
                        epitome and complement of all created natures; Nay, som have prophanely
                        affirmed, that if all the Angells in Heven had bin a thousand years a
                        forming man, they could not have made him in greater perfection, and yet when I seriously
                        oftentimes did
                        contemplat Man, and fell into a tru account of his imbecillities, and that
                        world of weaknesses which use to attend his body and mind, I have often
                        cryed out, <span class="original_italics">Eheu nos miseri quàm totus Homuncio nil est!</span> What nomberles diseases is his frail body, which is the

                        then any file, and being fryed and drunck with wine it cures the bloodyflix;
                        The Load-stone rub'd with Garlick loseth its attractive vertu, but being
                        dipt in Goats milk it recovers: Ther's no creture hears more perfectly then

                        The marrow of a Goat is singular good against Aches; The gall mixed with
                        hony good to clear and fortifie the sight; The very trindles drunck in wine
                        are good against the Jaundise, and to stay Female-fluxes, as also gargariz'd
                        good against old coughs; The fatt sodden with Goats dung is good if applied
                        to the Gout; The butter of the fatt of a male Goat is good for an old sore
                        for Kibes, the Kings-Evill, and Fellons, or mixed with hony or oyl of
                        Brambles 'tis good against deafnes; The gall makes white hair grow on a
                        horse; Goats milk is excellent against Consumptions, and you know how the
                        famous <span class="original_italics">Aegistus</span> was nurs'd by that milk. To conclude, ther's

                        frequent amongst Mankind; It being a principle from the very instinct of
                        nature amongst us, that it is both detestable and damnable for Subjects to
                        rise up against their supream Governour, and go about to right themselfs by
                        Arms; I say, that in this state we have a very regular Government, we have a
                        King, we have privy Counsellors, we have Commanders in the War, and
                        gregarian Soldiers; We keep close in Winter, and have then our Centinells;
                        We go not abroad till <br><span class="page_number">page 137</span><br> Beans do blossom,
                        and then, if the weather permit, ther's never a day passeth in idlenesse; We
                        first build our Cells and Combs, then make Hony, and then engender; We make
                        our Wax and Hony of the freshest and most fragrant flowers, and abhor
                        withered or stinking vegetalls; When the flowers are spent in one place, we
                        have our harbingers abroad to find out another; being surprised by night in
                        our expeditions, we sleep in a supine posture with our bellies upward, to
                        preserve our wings from the falling dew; Betimes in the morning we are
                        awakned by our Drummer, who punctually performs his office that way; Then,
                        if the day be mild, we fally forth in a great body, and we have an instinct
                        to foresee winds, tempests, and rain, which makes us keep often within; When
                        we go abroad to work, every one hath his task, and the younger are put to
                        the hardest, while the elder labour within dores; We all feed together, and
                        if we be surprised abroad with a sudden wind, we take up a stone 'twixt our
                        feet to give weight to our bodies, that they may not be blown away; Ther is
                        among us a Censor of manners, and som Officers that watch those which are
                        slothfull, who are afterwards pu nish'd with death, and for the
                        <span class="original_italics">Drones,</span> which are a spurious kind of brood, we quite banish
                        them; Ther's not the least foulnes seen in our Alvearies or Hives, for we
                        abhor all immundicities and sordidnes; When 'tis towards night, our hummings
                        lessen by degrees, till an Officer fly about and command silence and sleep,
                        which is instantly done; We first build houses for our Workmen and Plebeans,
                        and then palaces for the Nobles and the King; We punish sloth without mercy;
                        we faithfully obey our King, being always about him like a guard, and He in
                        the midst; When the peeple are at work, He goes about and cherisheth them,
                        He onely being exempt from labour; He hath always his Officers ready to
                        punish Delinquents; When He goes forth, the whole Swarm attends him, if He
                        chance to be weary, we bear him upon our sholders; Whersoever He rests,
                        there the generall Randevous <br><span class="page_number">page 138</span><br> is; Wasps,
                        Hornets, and Swallows are enemies to us; We bury our dead with great
                        solemnity; At the Kings death ther is a generall mourning and fasting, with
                        a cessation from labour, and we use to go about his body with a sad murmur
                        for many daies; When we are sick we have attendants appointed us, and the
                        symptoms when we be sick are infallible, according to <span class="footnote" id="#Pliny" data-content="" href="" data-toggle="popover" data-html="true" data-placement="top" data-animation="true" data-trigger="focus" tabindex="0" data-offset="0, 0">the honest plain Poet</span>, <span class="w3-panel"></span><br> Nor are we profitable onely in our lifes unto Mankind, by that pretious Hony

                        hold, that neither the seed of mother or father go to the impregnation, but
                        that the Female conceives onely by a virtuall contact, as the Loadstone

                        as soon as the prolificall emissions of both sexes are blended by mutuall
                        fermentation, for then the conformative and proper operations of the

                        is no lesse then an absurdity to think, that the Infant after conception
                        shold be majorated by the influence of any other <span class="original_italics">Soul</span> then that

                        be strongly inferred, that if organization, and the conformation of the

                        the <span class="original_italics">Rationall</span> Soul <span class="original_italics">then</span> works in the seed, as being the

                        by her <span class="original_italics">desires,</span> her <span class="original_italics">apprehensions,</span> and her

                        infinit we know, and never satisfied in this world; Now, it is a

                        <span class="original_italics">matter,</span> and from the clashing of contraries; Now, when the Soul
                        is sever'd from the Body, she is elevated beyond the sphere of
                        <span class="original_italics">matter,</span> therfore no causes of mortality can reach her, wherby
                        her <span class="original_italics">state</span> and <span class="original_italics">operations</span> pronounce her <span class="original_italics">immortall,</span>
                        which operations she doth exercise without the ministery of corporeall
                        organs, for they were us'd to be a clog to her; Add hereunto, that she useth
                        to spiritualize <span class="original_italics"> materiall </span> things in the Intellect, to abstract
                        Idaeas from Individualls; She can apprehend <span class="original_italics">negations</span> and <span class="original_italics">
                           privations, </span> she can frame <span class="original_italics">collective notions,</span> all which

                        operations being without the ministery of <span class="original_italics">Matter,</span> she may be

                        pure independent <span class="original_italics">Beeing,</span> for ther will be neither action or passion
                        in that state; Whence may be inferr'd, she shall never perish, in regard
                        that all <span class="original_italics">corruption</span> comes from the action of another thing upon
                        <span class="original_italics">that</span> which is corruptible, therfore that thing must <br><span class="page_number">page 148</span><br> be capable to be made better or worse; Now, if a
                        <span class="original_italics"> separat Soul </span> be plac'd in her ultimat and utmost state, that
                        she can be made <span class="original_italics">neither,</span> it follows, that she can never lose the
                        <span class="original_italics">Beeing</span> she hath; Besides, since the egress out of the body doth
                        not alter her <span class="original_italics">nature,</span> but onely her <span class="original_italics">condition,</span> it must be
                        granted, that she was of the same nature while she continued
                        <span class="original_italics">incorporated,</span> though in that kind of imprisonment she was
                        subject to be forg'd as it were by the hammer of <span class="original_italics">materiall</span> objects
                        beating upon her, yet so, as she was still of her self what she was;
                        Therefore when she goes out of the passible ore wherein she suffer'd, by
                        reson of the foulnes and impurity of that ore, she immediately becomes
                        impassible, and a fix'd subject of her own nature, <span class="original_italics">viz.</span> a
                        <span class="original_italics">simple pure Beeing;</span> Both which (as a most noble Knight Sir. <span class="original_italics">K.
                           D.</span> hath it) may be illustrated in some mesure by what we
                        find passeth in the coppilling of a fixed metall, which as long as any lead
                        or drosse or any allay remains with it, continueth still melting, flowing,
                        and in motion under the muffle; but as soon as they are parted from it, and
                        that 'tis become pure, defaecated, without mixture, and single of it self,
                        it contracts it self to a narrower room, and instantly ceaseth from all
                        motion, it grows hard, permanent, and resistent to all force of fire,
                        admitting no change or diminution in its substance by any externall
                        violence; In like manner it may be said, when the <span class="original_italics">Rational</span> Soul
                        departs from the drossy ore of the Body, and comes to be her <span class="original_italics">single
                           self,</span> she is like ex alted Gold, and reduc'd to the utmost
                        perfection; She can be no more liable to any diminution, to action or
                        passion, or any kind of alteration, but continues fix'd for ever in the full
                        fruition of unconceivable blisse and glory. <br></p>

                        expresse them in their perfection were the same task, as to go about to
                        measure the Ocean in Cockle-shells, or com pute the nomber of the sands with
                        peeble stones; Touching these faint and fading plesures among the

                        nauseat after fulness; Carnall delights cause sadnes after the enjoyment;
                        All plesures breed not onely a satiety but a disgust, and the contentment
                        terminats with the act: 'Tis otherwise with Celestiall things, they are most
                        lov'd when they are enjoy'd, and most coveted when they are had; They are
                        always full of what is desir'd, and the desire still lasteth, but it is a
                        co-ordinat desire of complacency and continuance, not an appetit after more,
                        because they are perfect of them selfs; Yet ther is still a Desire, and a
                        Satiety, but the one finds no want, nor can the other breed a surfet; The
                        higher the plesure is, the more full and intense is the fruition, and the
                        oftner 'tis repeted the more the appetit encreaseth; Whence this conclusion
