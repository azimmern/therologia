            <editorialDecl>
                <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the
                    publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on
                    the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO)
                    database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode
                    one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title
                    published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
                <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual
                    project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic
                    transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly
                    structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative
                    (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
                <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during
                    Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January
                    2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we
                    respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original
                    source.</p>
                <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of
                    any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
                <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature
                    (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL,
                    then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range
                    over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print
                    record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were
                    prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably
                    Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was
                    chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
                <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic
                    encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford
                    and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was
                    proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned
                    to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or
                    corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to
                    a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as
                    gaps. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall
                    quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable
                    characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all
                    likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
                <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of
                    the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
                <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text
                    with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters
                    represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless
                    XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g
                    elements).</p>

                        <hi>Northwest Iland,</hi> where ther reign'd a Queen call'd
                        <hi>Morphandra</hi>, descended of the High-born <hi>Circe,</hi> daughter of
                        <hi>Sol,</hi> who (according to the Etymology of her name) had power to
                    transmute and metamorphose <hi>Men</hi> to <hi>Beasts; Pererius</hi> having
                    obtain'd leave of her to see and speak with divers of them, <hi>viz,</hi> an

                    perswade them therunto, but in regard of the rebellious Humors, the horrid
                    Sacriledges, the new-fangled Opinions, and gingling Extravagances that
                        <hi>Human</hi> brains are subject unto, specially this last doting and

                    never so equally poiz'd; It is denied to <hi>Man</hi> to be always at Home

                <head>To the Severer sort OF REDERS.</head>
                <p> SOm of the Antient <hi>Sages,</hi> who were rank'd among the <hi> Philosophers
                    </hi> of the <hi>Upper House,</hi> had a Speculation, That the <hi>World</hi>
                    was but one huge <hi>Animal</hi> or Living Creture, compos'd of innumerable
                    members and parts, som <hi>Homogeneous</hi> or similar, others
                        <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> or dissimilar; And in order to <hi>that</hi> they
                    held, That God Almighty was the Great <hi>Soul</hi> which did inform and actuat
                    the whole <hi>Bulk</hi> with motion and life, with vertu and vigor, for every
                    part to perform its peculiar function towards the preservation of the
                        <hi>Whole:</hi> According to this Doctrin an Argument may be drawn by way of
                        <hi>Induction,</hi> That if the parts begin to impair, the <hi>Whole</hi>
                    must be in a declining condition; It hath been a Truth which hath pass'd from
                    all times without controul, that <hi>Mankind</hi> is one of the <hi>prime
                        parts</hi> of the <hi>Universe</hi> and <hi>Paramount</hi> of the
                        <hi>Sublunary</hi> World, which is demonstrable by that <hi>Dominion</hi>
                    which was given him over all his fellow-Cretures in <hi>Aire, Water,</hi> or
                        <hi>Earth;</hi> He can make the towring <hi>Eagle</hi> stoop to his Lure
                    from the middle Region; He can make the vast <hi>Leviathan,</hi> though a
                    hundred times bigger than himself, to flounce from the deep to do him homage on
                    the Shore; He can make the <hi>Elephant,</hi> though forty times stronger than
                    himself, to draw up his Ships on the <ref type="editorial" target="#carine"
                        >Carine</ref>, and do other drudgeries; This appears also out of that
                        <hi>Awe,</hi> which by a kind of naturall instinct all other
                        <hi>Animals</hi> use to shew <hi>Him;</hi> Insomuch that tryall hath been
                    made, how if a <hi>Man</hi> should go naked and with a confidence through the
                        <hi>Arabian</hi> Desarts, where the gretest concours of wild Beasts useth to
                    be, ther's none will assault him, but in a gazing and awfull kind of posture
                    they will keep their distance: Now, if <hi>Man,</hi> who is so considerable a
                        <hi>part</hi> of the world, doth decay in his <hi>Species,</hi> 'tis a
                    shrewd symptom that the <hi>Whole</hi> is <hi xml:lang="fr">en decadence,</hi>
                    in a declining state; Now, that <hi>Man</hi> doth impair as well in his
                        <hi>Intellectualls</hi> and the Faculties of his Soul, as in the motions and
                    affections of his heart, this present Age can afford more pregnant proofs than
                    most of the Ages before; For touching the <hi>First,</hi> What fond futilous new
                    Opinions <pb facs="tcp:98502:6"/> have bin hatch'd of late times, both in
                        <hi>Divinity</hi> and in the Idaeas of holy things, as well as in all other
                        <hi>Sciences,</hi> specially in the Art of <hi>Policy,</hi> wherin such poor
                        <ref type="editorial" target="#sciolist">

                        <hi>Lion</hi>'s neck, or make a Child's shoo to fit a Giant's foot. </p>
                <p> Touching the motions of the Heart, ther's nothing of that love and offices of
                        <hi>Humanity</hi> which were used to be, not onely among private persons and
                    neighbours, but that <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> which Subjects were
                    us'd to shew towards their lawfull Prince decaies more and more, whereof ther
                    have been strange examples of late years; In <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> a large antient
                    Empire, the common peeple did rise up with a petty Companion against their
                    Soveraign, and kill'd him with his two Sons in open field; In
                        <hi>Constantinople,</hi> two <hi>Gran Signors</hi> were thrust out of the
                    world by their own Slaves, yet they went not to that heighth of Impudence as to
                    arraign <hi>Them</hi> before a Barr of Iustice; The <hi>Swed</hi> hath quite
                    revolted from the <hi>Pole,</hi> the <hi>Portugues</hi> from the

                    <p> Well, that I may acquit my self of the promise I made unto you, Prince
                            <hi>Pererius,</hi> let us fetch a walk in those flowry fields towards
                        the banks of that River, to take in the freshness of the air, with the
                        fragancy of those Vegetals: And now, in a favourable conjuncture of time, I
                        spy a metamorphosed Creture among those seggs, fit for your purpose; It is
                        an <hi>Otter,</hi> whom I remember to have transmuted from a Mariner or
                        Seaman, for his <ref type="editorial" target="#deboshments"
                            >deboshments</ref> here; and I observe, ther are no people so given to
                        excesses as Seamen when they come ashore; which yet may be somwhat excused,
                        for it is to recompence the hardships they endured at Sea: Nor was it an
                        improper change for me to metamorphos the <hi>

                        Fisherman, useth to do: but there was another reson which induced me to this
                        transmutation, for it related to the quality of the Countrey whence he
                        sprung, which is so inlayed, and every where so intercutt, and indented with
                        the Sea, or fresh navigable Rivers, that one cannot tell what to call it,
                        either water or land; besides, the Inhabitants dwell so low, that they lye
                        lower than the Sea in some places. And now you may make your approaches, and
                        parly with him accordingly, while I walk up the River to visit my Nymphs.

                        as the inside; ther's never a room in their house, where so much dust may be

                        tell you, that to be a <hi>Mariner,</hi> or <ref type="editorial"

                        within so narrow a compass all the while. Touching the hardship and
                        toylsomness of this trade, let me tell you, that to plow, dig, delve, or
                        thresh, are but exercises of ease, compar'd to our labor in distress of

                        at my nose, and fingers-ends? How oft did I eat Bisket, so mouldy, that

                    <p> It is given for granted, that Man comes naked into the World, yet he hath
                        the mastery and command, he hath the breaking, daunting, and disposing of
                        all other Cretures for his own turn, both in Air, Earth, &amp; Water, to
                        cloath and feed him, according to his free election and plesure; for all
                        other elementary Cretures are made for his use, and principally to that end.
                        Now 'tis a true Maxim, that <quote type="#proberb">the <hi>end</hi> is more

                        and nourish you, but much labor and toyl must be used, before you can bring
                        them to serve your turn; What a deal of work must precede, ere the Tanner
                        and Furrier can make our Skins fit for your wear? What huge varieties of

                        made Bread, and Barly Drink? Ther must be ploughing, harrowing, sowing,
                        weeding, reaping, sheafing, stacking, barning, threshing, winnowing,
                        sacking, grinding, bolting, fermenting, and baking, before you can get a bit
                        of Bread to keep you from starving: What a deal of stirr must be us'd,
                        before you can get a Shirt on your back, or a handkercher to wipe your noses
                        withall? There must be <hi>planting, cutting down, hundling, watring,
                            rippling, braking, wingling, and heckling of Hemp;</hi> which laberinth

                    <p> It is without controversie tru, that Man is born to sundry sorts of labors,
                        but it is principally to exercise his spirits, and the faculties of the

                        use to exhaust their estates, and impoverish themselfs, to enrich others by
                        this means; As I remember to have heard a facetious passage of a wealthy
                        Lawyer, who having built a fair Palace of Free-stone, with Marble
                        intermix'd, and having invited a knowing friend of his to take a view of the
                        new house, and observe the symmetry, proportion, &amp; conveniencies of the
                        fabric, He asked his friend at last, what he thought that House was built
                        of? He answered, I see 'tis built of good Free-stone and Marble, The Lawyer
                        replied, No, Sir, 'tis a <hi xml:lang="la">deceptio visûs</hi> in you, for
                        this house is made of <hi>Asses heads</hi> and <hi>Fools sculls,</hi>
                        meaning the multitude of Clients he had had. To such the proverb may
                        sometimes be applied, that as the <hi>Asse oftentimes carries gold on his
                            back, yet feeds on thistles,</hi> so many poor Clients carry gold in
                        their pockets to feed their Lawyers, yet they fare hard themselfs, and are
                        ready to famish. But to leave off these imperti nences, you may please to go
                        on in the pursute of your enterprise, to try whether yonder long-ear'd

                                >Artonia</placeName>
                        </hi> in fecundity and self-sufficiency, yields to no other Region under the
                        Sun, which makes some call her a <hi>Noun substantive,</hi> that can stand
                        by it self; yet it may well be said, that ther's is no Country under the
                        cope of Heaven, where there's <hi>lesse want,</hi> and <hi>more
                            beggars,</hi> or <hi>more people,</hi> and <hi>fewer men;</hi> The reson
                        of the first, to my grief I speak it, is, that the common stock and wealth
                        of the Country is by Mal-administration so unequally proportion'd, and
                        distributed among the Native Inhabitants thereof; for the <hi>Court</hi> and
                        the <hi>Clergy</hi> suck the greatest part of the fat, whence grew the
                        Proverb, <hi>
                            <quote type="#proverb">What the Cheque takes not, the Church
                                takes</quote>.</hi> I speak not this, because I repine at any acts

                        Legacies left by sweet devoted souls. Touching the first, 'tis too <pb
                            n="19" facs="tcp:98502:21"/> well known, that the very <hi>Tallies,</hi>
                        besides the <hi>Demeans</hi> of the Crown, and the <hi>Customs,</hi> amount
                            <hi xml:lang="la">communibus annis</hi> to near upon twenty millions of
                        Crowns, wherof 'tis tru, that about four millions were remitted in the year
                        1648. Then the Gabell of <hi>Salt</hi> amounts to about seven millions every
                        year, which is look'd unto so narrowly, that a poor Peasan cannot carry a
                        pocket or purse-full of salt home to his poor wife, but he must be searched.
                        Then ther are the <hi xml:lang="fr">Taillons, Aydes, Droits,</hi> with
                        divers other Impositions and Taxes, which though at first they were
                        pretended to be impos'd for the present necessity of the times, yet
                        Soveraign Princes are known to have the gift of making Temporary things
                        Eternall in this kind; Neverthe lesse, if this immense tresure went to the
                        King's tresure alone, for the common defence and honour of the State, it
                        would not so much trouble them that pay it; but three parts of four are
                        drunk up among hungry Officers, whence grew the proverb, that <hi>

                    <p> Touching the second, by a late computation that was made, the
                            <hi>Clergy</hi> hath in annuall Revenue a hundred and six millions of
                        Crowns, and no wonder, ther being in that Country, besides
                            <hi>Cardinals,</hi> and fifteen <hi>Archbishops,</hi> a hundred and
                        fifty Suffragan <hi>Bishops,</hi> and I know not how many fat

                    <p> Then comes in the <hi>Noblesse,</hi> or Gentry, which have all the rest;

                        </hi> Gentry are so numerous, and use to rack the Peasantry so, that it

                        manner: for you know a <hi>Phrygian King</hi> did wear once an <hi>Asse</hi>
                        his ears, and he was the richest that ever was among Mortalls; Besides, my

                        my <hi>braying,</hi> it is the tone which Nature hath given me, and all the

                            <hi>braying</hi> you have a passion, and as I remember your Philosophers
                        call it the <hi>proper passion</hi> of man, that is a far more distorting
                        and ridiculous violent posture, 'tis your <hi>Laughter,</hi> which happens
                        when your pleasure hath the liberty to scatter it self abroad, and that the
                        senses bear a share therin, for then it causeth such an agitation, that the
                        whole physiognomy of the face is changed, it begins to sparkle in the eyes,
                        and mingleth it self oft-times with forc'd tears, the fore-head stretcheth
                        it self, the lips grow redd, they tremble and slaver often-times, the voice
                        becomes grosser then ordinary, and resounds, the rest of the body is subject
                        to this agitation, an unusuall heat and vapor shedds it self through all its
                        parts, which swells, and gives a new color, the eye-brows decline, the lidds
                        contract themselves, and all the skin about them becomes uneven, and
                        wrinkles it self all over, the eyes extenuat, they half shut themselfs, and

                        the cheeks lift up themselfs and grow more stiff, they have pitts digg'd in

                        tremblings of the suspended toung, it thrusts out an obstreperous
                        interrupted sound, and oftentimes ther is a stopping of breath, the neck
                        swells and shortens it self, all the veins grow greter, and extended, an
                        extraordinary hue disperseth it self over all the face, which grows reddish,
                        the brest is impetuously agitated, and with sudden reiterated shakes, that
                        it hinders respiration, the perfect use of speech is lost, and it is
                        impossible to swallow during the fit, a pain rises in the flanck, the whole

                            facs="tcp:98502:23"/> sweat gets up on the face, the voice is lost in
                        hickocks, and the breath is stifled with sighs; somtimes this agitation gets
                        to so high an excesse, that it produceth the same violent effect as
                        medicaments use to do, which is to put the bones so out of joynt that it
                        causeth syncopes; The head and the arms suffer the same throws, with the
                        brest and the thighs, the body hurles it self with precipitation and
                        disorder, and is cast from one side to the other; The hands becom feeble,
                        the leggs cannot support themselves, and the body is constrained to fall,
                        and tumble, nay it causeth sometimes dangerous syncopes in the heart, and so
                        brings death. <hi>Weeping</hi> also the counter-passion hath many of these
                        ill-favor'd motions, what an odd kind of face doth an infant make assoon as
                        he is born? how som of ripe age will screech, cry and howle in so many
                        disordered notes, and singultient accents? Whereas we by our
                            <hi>braying</hi> hold up our heads only, and so breath out our passions
                        into the open aire, without any forc'd tones, or such variety of distorted
                        postures. </p>

                        and melancholly thoughts with an unusuall mirth and complaceny, whence it

                    <p> Whereas you speak of fiercenesse, truly Sir I think ther's no Animal so
                        fierce and ferocious, so savage and intractable as <hi>Man:</hi> for whereas
                        all other cretures <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98502:25"/> can be rul'd, daunted,
                        and broken, easily govern'd in time, the Art of governing <hi>Men</hi> is
                        the most difficult of any, because of their various fancies and
                        imaginations, their crosse-grain'd humors and pride, all which proceeds from
                        the faculty of <hi>Reson</hi> you speak of; Therefore I was very glad to be
                        rid of it by this transfiguration, and the time seems tedious unto me that I
                        have the use of it now so long to parly with you, for I remember when I was
                        a <hi>Man,</hi> it fill'd the cells of my brain ever and anon with turbid
                        and turbulent cogitations, with strange chimera's and crochets, which
                        disquieted the tranquillity and calm of my mind; And as for my
                            <hi>Body,</hi> this shape which I now bear is more healthfull farr and
                        neat, for now I am not subject to breed <hi>Lice</hi> and other Vermin; And
                        whereas this pedicular disease, with a nomberlesse sort of other maladies
                        and distempers, attend Mankind, ther's but one onely disease that our
                        Species is subject unto, which the <hi>Veterenarians</hi> or Far riers call
                            <hi>Malila,</hi> and that is onely in the head, when som unusuall
                        defluxion of rheume falls thence into the nostrills, which being stopp'd
                        turns to the improvement of health, but if once it falls upon the lungs we
                        are gone: And observable it is, that being dead, we have cleaner carcases
                        than <hi>Men,</hi> and di vers medicinall things are found in them, as our
                        Li ver, Hoofs, or Bones being reduc'd to powder are good, as the Naturalists
                        note, against the Epilepsy or Comitiall sicknesse, with other diseases; Nor
                        do any crawling nasty worms grow out of our Cadavers, but Beetles, and other
                        airy Insects, which are not so noisome; But I have spent too much time with
                        you, I will therefore go now to browze upon the green leafs of that Bramble.

                            facs="tcp:98502:26"/> thought it proper to transmute to that shape;
                        Besides, I turn'd him to that long-tail'd beast, because they of his country
                        are called <hi>Stertmen</hi> that is men with long-tailes, for which ther is
                        both Tradition and Story; He came hither Chaplain to a Frigot, and had not
                        the ship quickly tack'd about and got away, I had transfigur'd all the rest.

                        been observed that those three scourges of Heven, <w xml:lang="gr"
                        >λιμοσ</w>, <w xml:lang="gr">λοιμοσ</w>, and <w xml:lang="gr">πολεμοσ</w>,
                        the Famine, the Plague, and the civill Warrs are consecutif, and use to
                        follow one another, though the last hath got the start of the other two; But
                        concerning the peeple, I verily believe ther were never any so far

                        and puppifie themselfs into such a perfect slavery and confusion; You seem

                        another in so savage a manner; All which proceeds from a sad disease which
                        hath seiz'd upon many thousands of them, it is a pure <hi>Scotomia,</hi> an

                        amongst them, which turns the head round, and fills it with new chimera's
                        ever and anon; 'Tis tru that my country-men were ever observ'd to be
                        inconstant in the fashion of their cloathing, in their outward comportment
                        and garbs, which proceeded from <hi>Imitation</hi> more then naturall

                            <hi>habitudes</hi> of their minds, and taken hold of their

                        fanaticall newfangled opinions, blown over from other Countreys, and then
                        multiplying amongst them; For though my countrey-men have not any great
                        Genius to <hi>invent,</hi> yet 'tis observ'd they have a faculty to
                            <hi>add</hi> to any new invention; and if any new odd opinion in Holy
                        things hath once taken footing among them, they will make it run upon more
                        feet; Now it is in <hi>Divinity</hi> as in <hi> Philosophy, Uno absurdo dato

                        like ill weeds do grow apace; And truly I must confesse, that this apish
                        humor had seiz'd strongly upon me, which made me distrub the peace of the
                        holy Church wherin I was born, baptized, and bred, which made Queen
                            <hi>Morphandra</hi> to transform me justly to this shape you see, being
                        entertain'd Chaplain to a Man of War that arriv'd at this Island, though I

                        </hi> a comely face of a Church; Ther were such solemnities, venerations,
                        and decencies us'd, that might discover som piety in the practice of holy
                        duties; Ther was a public Liturgy that link'd the souls of the whole Nation
                        in an unanimity, wherin ther were such pithy patheticall prayers that
                        reached all occasions, and searched every crany in the conscience; The
                        Sacraments were administred with a fitting posture of reverence, and
                        genuflexion, yet far from any superstition; God's houses <pb n="31"
                            facs="tcp:98502:27"/> were kept neat, cleanly, and in repair; There was
                        such a prudent handsom Government, such degrees of promotion, such
                        possessions annex'd to the Church, that made them of that holy function not
                        onely to be esteem'd and reverenc'd, but to be able to do deeds of charity;
                        But now I hear ther's crept up such a nasty race of miscreants, who have no
                        more esteem of God Almighty's House than of a Pig-sty, who have turn'd a

                        plunder'd all that belong'd to pious uses, who have nothing of that
                        veneration, that sweetnes, and comfort that useth to attend tru devotion,
                        which is turn'd to a giddy zeal, or a kind of <hi>lust</hi> still after more
                        learning, as if <hi>Christianity</hi> had no consistence or certainty, no
                        sobriety; or end of knowledg, wherin the inward man might acquiesce; These
                        poor simpletons pretending to imitate the Apostles time wold have the same
                        form of Discipline and Mode to govern whole Nations, as it did at first a

                        five: But you were speaking of other dreadfull judgments that you believe

                    <p> It chanc'd one night I had a strange unusuall Dream, I had fallen into so

                        becom a <hi>Spirit;</hi> I had all night long a world of visions, and
                        strange objects appeerd unto me, which return now fresh into my memory;
                        During the said time I thought I was transported to the remotest place, and
                        of the greatest distance that possibly could be from Heven, me thought I was
                        in the <hi>Infernall pit,</hi> in the kingdom of darknesse, in Hell it self
                        among the devills and damned spirits, I had neither that golden branch, nor
                        the help of a <hi>Sybilla Cumana</hi> to conduct me up and down as the
                        Trojan Prince had, but a spirit did lead me gently and softly all along
                        untill I came to <hi>Pluto</hi> 's Palace, where a speciall Councell was
                        held to take a strict examination what service the three infernall Furies,
                            <hi>Alecto, Tisyphone,</hi> and <hi>Megaera,</hi> with other in feriour
                        Fiends that were their assistants, had done upon earth towards the
                        advancement of the king dom of darknesse since their last mission thither,
                        which was presently upon the appeerance of the last blazing Star 1618.
                            <hi>Pluto</hi> vouchsafed to be present at this solemn Councell, and to
                        be President or <hi>Chair-man</hi> himself, to which purpose he had a strong

                        appointed of purpose for that end (whence I observed, that Committees were
                        first hatch'd in Hell) The three gastly Daughters of Night appeered with

                        Assembly upon a suddain, because the members therof were not for our turn,

                        their courses all the while with a great deal of care; The first thing we
                        did was to endue them with a faculty to <hi>create</hi> fears and
                        jealousies, whereof we made excellent use, and although those fears and
                        jealousies appeared afterwards to every common man as plain as the nose on
                        his face to be but meer forgeries, and supposititious things, yet we did
                        still so intoxicat their intellectualls, that we made them to adore still

                        among divers others, one most pregnant and unde niable demonstration what
                        firm footing we got in that <hi>Island,</hi> we did raise in few years more
                            <hi>Pythonesses,</hi> which the ignorant vulgar call Witches there, then
                        ever were in that Country since your Majesty tempted <hi>Eve;</hi> and we

                        their <hi>Bandogs,</hi> to rabble the King out of Town, we brought also

                        and down the streets with papers in their hats they knew not about what; We
                        managed the businesse afterwards so dextrously, and did aggravate things by
                        degrees, that we made their credulous King, because he was so profess'd an

                        summe, we have reduc'd that Country to a conformity with this of your
                        Majesties, to a perfect Chaos of all confusion, we have brought the sway
                        into the common peeples hands, making all the <hi>Nobility</hi> and
                            <hi>Gentry</hi> to crouch and cringe unto them; And never did common
                        peeple more truly act the part, and discover the genius of a common peeple
                        more lively, whose nature is still thirsting after novelties, and
                            <hi>Utopian</hi> Reformations, though oftentimes they fool themself
                        thereby into a a baser kind of slavery, finding when 'tis too late those
                        specious idaea's, and confus'd forms of Government they apprehended at
                        first, and hugg'd in their own conceits, to be at last but meer absurdities,
                        when they com to the application and practise therof. </p>
                    <p> And, Sir, the most advantageous instruments we have us'd to bring all this
                        about have bin the <hi>Pulpit</hi> and the <hi>Presse,</hi> by these we
                        diffus'd those supposititious fears and jealousies, formerly spoken of, to
                        distract the brains of the silly vulgar; Instead of <hi>Lights</hi> we put
                            <hi>Firebrands</hi> in their Churches, who, according as we did dictat
                        unto them, did baul out nothing but sediti on, war, and blood; We have made
                        som of them to have as good an opinion of the <hi>Alchoran</hi> as of their
                        own <hi>Liturgy;</hi> We made new <hi> Ordinances </hi> to batter down all
                        the antient <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church, we have made them to un-saint all
                        those who were call'd <hi>Apostles,</hi> to prophane and plunder all places
                        that were consecrated, we brought som of them to put a division 'twixt the
                            <hi>Trinity</hi> it self, we have brought them to keep their
                            <hi>Fasts</hi> more solemnly than the <hi>Sabboth,</hi> upon which day
                        we made them usually not onely to sit in Councell, but to put in execution
                        their chief designs of blood; To work all this, the main and most materiall
                        thing we made use of was <hi>spirituall pride</hi> your Majesty's old
                        acquaintance, which pride we have infus'd into the mind of every Mechanic,
                        or Country-Swain, who will boldly now undertake to expound any Text of
                        Scripture new or <pb n="37" facs="tcp:98502:30"/> old upon the warrant of
                        his own giddy brain; Insomuch that we have made that Book which they call
                        the <hi>Bible,</hi> that was ordained for the Charter of their
                            <hi>Salvation,</hi> to be the chiefest instrument of their <hi>
                            Damnation; </hi> We have brought those exotic words <hi>Plundring</hi>
                        and <hi>Storming,</hi> and that once abominable word <hi>Excise</hi> to be
                        now familiar among them, they are all made free Denizens, and naturaliz'd
                        among them; We have made those who came petitioners for <hi>peace</hi> to
                        the great Councill to be ill intreated, and som of them to be murther'd, but
                        those that came for <hi>warr</hi> to be countenanc'd and thank'd; We made
                        the mother to betray her child, the child the father, the husband the wife,
                        and the servant his master; We have brought a perfect Tyranny over their
                        souls and bodies, upon the one, by tedious imprisonments and captivity, with
                        a forfeiture of all their livelihoods before conviction, or any preceding
                        charge, upon the other, by forcing them to take contradictory <hi>Oaths,
                            Engagements,</hi> and <hi>Protestations;</hi> On that foolish
                        superstitious day of <hi>Christmas,</hi> with other Festi vals, we have
                        brought them to shut up their Churches, and to open their Shops and
                        Shambles, so that in time they will forget the very memory of the
                            <hi>Incarnation</hi> of their Saviour; We have brought them to have as
                        little reverence of their <hi>Temples</hi> as of their <hi>Tap-houses,</hi>
                        and to hold the Church to be no more than a Charnell-house of rotten bones;
                        And though they still cringe and stand bare-headed before any wrangling
                        Bench of common pleading, yet we have so stiffned their joynts, and made
                        their heads so tender in that which they call God's House, that there, they
                        can neither bow the one, nor scarce uncover the other; We have made the
                        fundamentall Laws to be call'd but <hi>meer formalities;</hi> We have made
                        that which was call'd their Great Charter to be torn to a thousand flitters,
                        and stretcht the <hi>priviledge</hi> of the Commons so wide, that it hath
                        quite swallowed the Royall <hi> Prerogative, </hi> and all other
                        priviledges; We have grub'd up, and cast away those hopefull Plants that
                        grew in <pb n="38" facs="tcp:98502:31"/> their <hi>two Seminaeries</hi> of
                        Learning, and set in them graffs of our own choice; We have made the wealth
                        of Town and Country, of Poor and Rich, to shine in plunder upon the
                        Souldiers backs; We have made them command <hi>free-quarter</hi> of those,
                        that were more sitting to ask <hi>alms</hi> of them; We have made them rifle
                        the Monuments of the dead, to rob the very Laza retro, to strip the Orphan
                        and Widow; We have made them offer violence to the very Vegetables and
                        inanimat Stones, to violat any thing that was held holy, to make Socks of
                        Surplices, to water their beasts at the Font, and feed them on the Altar,
                        and to term the thing they cal the Sacrament to be but a two-penny Ordinary;
                        We have made them use on the close stoole that Book wherein the public
                        Devotion of the whole Nation consisted; In fine, we have made them turn
                        supposed superstition to gross prophaness, preaching to prating, praying to
                        raving, government to con fusion, and freedom to fetters; We have so
                        intoxica ted that dear daughter of yours <hi>Polihaima,</hi> that she knows
                        not what way to turn her self; And whereas her Apprentices did rise up like
                        so many Cubs of Tygers against their lawfull Prince, they are now becom as
                        came as so many silly sheep against the Souldiery; We have puzzled their
                        Pericranium with vertiginous fancies, and fears among themselfs, that one
                        neighbour dare not trust the other; To conclude, we have eclipsed the glory
                        of that Nation, we have made them by all peeple far and neer that ever had
                        knowledg, correspondence, or any commerce with them, to be pittied by som,
                        to be laugh'd at by others, to be scorn'd of all, and to becom the very tail
                        of all Nations; In fine, Sir, we have brought that Country to such a passe
                        of confusion, that it is a fit place onely for your infernall Majesty to
                        keep your Court in, for ther's never a <hi>Crosse</hi> there to fright you
                        now: 'Tis tru they retain it still upon their coines of gold and silver, in

                            <hi>Charon</hi> hath entertaind for his journey-men. </p>
                    <p> Having listned all this while unto what pass'd 'twixt <hi>Pluto</hi> and his
                        Furies, my guiding spirit did lead me up and down Hell to see the various
                        sorts of torments that are there, which indeed are innumerable both old and
                        new; The first I beheld was <hi>Ixion</hi> who was tyed with ugly Vipers to
                        a wheel that whirl'd about perpetually, and I might perceive a multitude of
                        lesser wheels newly made therabouts, wherunto great nombers of <hi>
                            <persName type="cypher" subtype="plu" ref="#Gheriona"
                                >Gherionians</persName>,</hi> and divers of my acquaintants were
                        bound in like manner; I might discern also hard by a huge company of new
                            <hi>Windmills,</hi> and bodies tyed with black-spotted Snakes at every
                        wing turning round perpetually; A little further ther were a great many
                        broken by <hi>Milstones</hi> who were whirl'd with them about incessantly;
                        In another place I might see black <hi>Whirlpools</hi> full of tormented
                        souls turning still round, I asked what was the reson of so many whirling
                        tortures? My good Spirit answered, All these, except <hi>Ixion</hi> 's
                        wheel, are new torments appointed for <hi>
                            <name type="cypher" subtype="adj" ref="#Gheriona">Gherionian</name>
                        </hi> Sectaries, who had destroyed from top to bottom all Government both of
                        Church and State, And as their brains turn'd round upon earth after every
                        wind of Doctrine, so their souls turn here in perpetuall torments of
                        rotation. </p>
                    <p> A little further I spied <hi>Prometheus</hi> removed thither from
                            <hi>Caucasus,</hi> with a ravenous Vulture tearing and feeding upon his
                        liver, which as one part was eaten, renewed presently after, and abundance
                        of new commers were tormented in the same manner, these <pb n="41"
                            facs="tcp:98502:32"/> I was told they were <hi>

                                >Gherionian</persName>s</hi> also that were punishd like
                            <hi>Prometheus,</hi> because as he was tortured so for stealing fire
                        from Heven, by which was meant for prying too far into the secrets of the
                        gods, so those fiery Zelots of <hi>
                            <placeName type="cypher" subtype="place" ref="#Gheriona"
                                >Gheriona</placeName>
                        </hi> were tortured, for offring to dive too far into the high points of
                            <hi>Predestination, Election,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> being not
                        contented <hi>sapere ad sobrietatem,</hi> but were gaping ever and anon
                        after new lights, and flashes of illuminations to pry into the Book of Life. </p>
                    <p> Then I came to the bottomles Tub which <hi>Danaus</hi> daughters were a
                        filling, a nomberles company of other such tubs were there, and <hi>
                            <name type="cypher" subtype="adj" ref="#Gheriona">Gherionian</name>
                        </hi> women and men were incessantly labouring to fill them up with the
                        stenchy black waters of <hi>Acheron;</hi> I was told that they were those
                        over-curious peeple in <hi>
                            <placeName type="cypher" subtype="place" ref="#Gheriona"
                                >Gheriona</placeName>
                        </hi> which wold be never satisfied with spirituall knowledg, having no
                        other devotion than to be alwaies <hi>learning,</hi> and never comming to
                        the truth, as these poor restlesse fillers could never come to any bottom. </p>
                    <p> Then I beheld the most horrid tortures of those Giants who wold have pulld
                            <hi>Iupiter</hi> out of his Throne, and a world of <hi>

                        </hi> among them, who partaked of the same tortures, because they had
                        conspir'd on earth to destroy their lawfull King. </p>
                    <p> Not far further I might spy dazling my eyes fiery glowing tubs made
                        Pulpit-like, and I was told they were prepared for those prophane
                        presumptuous Mechanicks, and other lay-men who use to preach, and so abuse
                        the sacred Oracles of God; And <hi>Uzza</hi> was not far off, who lay in
                        torments there for being too bold with the Holy Ark. </p>
                    <p> Not far distant I saw hoops of iron that were made <hi>Garter-like</hi> of
                        hot candent steel, I was told that they were design'd for the perjur'd
                        Knights of that <hi>Order</hi> in <hi>
                            <placeName type="cypher" subtype="place" ref="#Gheriona"
                                >Gheriona</placeName>
                        </hi> to wear upon their legs when they com thither, for breaking in the
                        late war the solemn Oath they had taken at their Installment, to <hi> defend
                            the Ho nour and Quarrells, the Rights and Dignities of their So verain,
                            &amp;c. </hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> Nere unto them I might see brasse hoops glowing <pb n="42"
                            facs="tcp:98502:33"/> with fire, and they were <hi>Scarfs-like,</hi> I
                        was told they were ordained for those Knights of the <hi>Bath</hi> to wear
                        for Ribbands next their skins when they came thither, for infringing that
                        sacred <hi>Sacramentall Oath</hi> they took at their election, which was,
                            <hi>To love their Soverain above all earthly creture, and for his Right
                            and Dignity to live and die.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> A little beyond I saw a <hi>Copper</hi> -table with chairs of the same, all
                        candent hot, I was told that those were for perjur'd Privy-Councellors who
                        had broke their Oath to their King, which obliged them to <hi>be tru and
                            faithfull servants unto him, and if they knew or understood any manner
                            of thing to be attempted, done, or spoken against his Majestie's Person,
                            Honour, Crown, or Dignity, they swore to lett and withstand the same to
                            the uttermost of their power, and cause it to be revealed either to
                            Himself, or any other of his Privy Councill.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> Hard by I saw a little Furnace so glowing hot, that it lookt of the colour
                        of a <hi>Ruby</hi> or <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> I was told that it was to clap in
                        the Master of a King's Jewellhouse when he comes thither, for being so
                        perfidious and perjurious to his Master. </p>
                    <p> Not far off I might see a huge brasse Caudron full of molten lead, with som
                        Brewers cruelly tormented therein, for setting their own Country on fire. </p>
                    <p> I was curious to know, whether ther were any other infernall tortures
                        besides those of <hi>fire;</hi> Yes, I was answered, for to speak of
                            <hi>fire</hi> to a peeple habituated to a cold Climat were not onely to
                        make them slight Hell, but to have a mind to go thither; So my Spirit
                        brought me a little Northward, and shewed me a huge Lough, where ther were
                        frosted Mountains up and down, and I might discover amongst them a world of
                            <hi>Blew-caps</hi> lying in beds of yce, with their noses and toes nipt,
                        the isicles stuck to their fingers ends like horns, and a bleak hispid wind
                        blew incessantly upon them, they made the most pitteous noise that
                        me-thought I had heard in all Hell, for they wawl'd, screech'd, and howl'd
                        out ever and anon this dismall note, <hi>Wea is me, wea is me that ever I
                            betraid my gid King.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:98502:33"/> Among all those damned souls I desired to
                        see what punishment an <hi>Atheist</hi> had, my Spirit was ready to answer
                        me, that ther were no <hi>Atheists</hi> in Hell at all; 'tis tru they were
                        so upon <hi>Earth</hi> before they came hither, but here they sensibly find
                        and acknowledge ther is a God by his justice and judgments, for ther is here
                            <hi>poena sensûs</hi> and <hi>poena damni,</hi> ther is inward and
                        outward torture, The outward torments you behold are nothing so grievous as
                        the inward regrets and agonies the souls have, to have lost <hi>Heven</hi>
                        wherof they were once capable, and to be eternally forsaken by their
                            <hi>Creator</hi> the Lord of Light, their chiefest Good; Add hereunto
                        that they know these torments to be endlesse, easelesse, and remedilesse;
                        Besides these qualities which are incident to the damned souls, they have
                        neither patience towards themselfs in their own suffrances, nor any pitty
                        towards others, but their natures is so accursed that they wish their
                        neighbours torments were still greter then their own; Moreover their
                        torments never lessen, or have any mitigation by tract of time, or degrees
                        of sense, but they persevere alwaies in the same heighth, they are still
                        fresh, and the soul made stronger to bear them; I saw that <hi>everlasting
                            Villain</hi> who committed one of the first sacriledges we read of, by
                        burning the Temple of <hi>Diana,</hi> whose torments were so fresh and
                        cruciatory upon him, as they were the first day he was hurl'd in thither;
                            <hi>Iudas</hi> was in the same degree and strength of torture as he was
                        the first moment he fell thither; <hi>Iack Cade, Wat Tyler, Iack Straw,</hi>
                        and <hi>Ket the Tanner</hi> did fry as fresh as they did that very instant
                        they were tumbled down thither; Amongst whom it made my heart to melt within
                        me when I saw som of their new-com'd Countrymen amongst them, wherof I knew
                        divers; And though <hi>society</hi> is wont to be some solace to men in mi
                        sery, yet they conceived no comfort at all by these fresh companions. </p>
                    <p> It is high time for us now, said my good guiding Spirit, to be gone to the
                        other world, so we directed our cours towards the Ferry upon <hi>Styx;</hi>
                        But Lord <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98502:34"/> what a nomber of lurid and ugly
                        squalid countenances did I behold as I pass'd; There was one sort of torment
                        I had not seen before, ther were divers that hung by their <hi>toungs</hi>
                        upon posts up and down, I asked what they were, answer was made, that they
                        were <hi>prick-ear'd Preachmen, Iudges,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> who
                        against their knowledg as well as against their consciences, did seduce the
                        ignorant peeple of <hi>

                                >Carboncia</placeName>,</hi> and incite them to war; And ther was a
                        new tenter-hook provided for one <hi xml:lang="fr">gran Villain,</hi> who
                        pronounced Sentence of death against his own Soverain Prince, whose
                            <hi>Subject</hi> he was, and whom by a sacred Oath of
                            <hi>Allegiance</hi> he was tyed to obey. </p>
                    <p> A little further I might see multitudes of Com mittee-men and others,
                        slopping up drops of <hi>molten lead</hi> in lieu of <hi>French
                            Barly-broth,</hi> with a rabble of <hi> Ap prentices </hi> sweeping the
                        gutters of Hell, with brooms tufted with ugly Adders and Snakes, because
                        they running into the Wars and leaving their <hi>wares,</hi> had therby
                        broke their Indentures with their Masters, and their Oaths of
                            <hi>Allegiance</hi> to their lawfull Prince. </p>
                    <p> Passing then along towards the Ferry, a world of hideous shapes presented
                        themselfs unto my sight; There I saw corroding cares, pannick fears, pining
                        griefs, ugly rebellion, revengefull malice, snaky discord, oppression,
                        tyranny, disobedience, perjury, sacriledge, and <hi>spirituall pride</hi>
                        (the sin that first peepled Hell) put to exquisit torments; Couches of
                        Toads, Scorpions, Asps, and Serpents were in a corner hard by; I asked for
                        whom they were prepared, I was answered, for som <hi>Evangelizing <name

                        </hi> Ladies, which did egg on their husbands to War; So having as I thought
                        by a miraculous providence charm'd three-headed <hi>Cerberus,</hi> by
                        pointing at him with the signe of the <hi>Crosse</hi> upon my fingers, we
                        passed quietly by to the Ferry, where being com I found tru what
                            <hi>Pluto</hi> had said before, that ther were divers <hi>

                        </hi> Tarpalins entertain'd by <hi>Charon,</hi> but they were in most cruell
                        tortures, for their bodies were covered all over very thick and close with
                        canvases pitch'd and <pb n="45" facs="tcp:98502:34"/> tarr'd, which

                    <p> Herewith I got awake again about the dawning of the day, and it was high

                                <l>I clos'd my eyes again to recollect</l>

                    <p> I say, that having after such a long noctivagation, and variety of horrid
                        visions, return'd to my perfect expergefaction, I began by a serious
                        recollection of my self to recall to my thoughts by way of reminiscence
                        those dismall and dreadfull objects that had appeerd unto me, for though I
                        was in <hi>Hell,</hi> yet I did not taste of <hi>Lethe</hi> all the while,
                        insomuch that I did not forget any thing which I had seen; All the said
                        objects presented themselfs unto me so reall, that if I had bin transported
                        with that opinion wherof many great Clerks have bin, <hi>viz.</hi> That
                        Devills are nothing els but the ill affections, the exorbitant passions and
                            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:98502:35"/> perturbances of the minde; I say, if I
                        had bin plac'd in such an opinion, this trance wold have convinc'd me; You
                        may easily imagin what apprehensions of horror these Apparitions left in my
                        brain behind them, just as a River when by an inundation she hath swel'd out
                        of her wonted channell, doth use to leave along the neighbouring medowes
                        seggs and other weeds with much riffraff stuff behind her upon her return to
                        her former bed; so did this Vision after that deluge of objects wherwith my
                        brain was overwhelm'd for the time, leave behind them black sudds, and many
                        a ghastly thought within me, which after some ruminations wrought in me a
                        perfect change and detestation of those mimicall giddy opinions wherwith I
                        was carried away before, but while I delayed the time of declaring my self
                        that way, I was suddenly surprized, and justly transmuted to this shape and
                        species. </p>

                    <p> You may perceive by the effects of this <hi>visional</hi> Dream the

                        leaving the grosse tabernacle of the body she can at plesure climb up to the

                        she can also descend in a trice to the great <hi>Abysse,</hi> and take a

                        regresses, she can enter and come off clear from <hi>Hell</hi> it self, when
                        she list, and all this in an instant; Wherin she may be said to participat
                        of that admired quality which is inhaerent in that most comfortable of all

                        for <hi>Light</hi> requires but an instantaneous moment or point of time to
                        perform <pb n="47" facs="tcp:98502:35"/> its office of illumination, and to
                        dilate it self from one Pole to the other throughout the whole Hemiphere,
                        whence some infer that <hi>Light</hi> is incorporeal, because 'tis an
                        unquestion'd principle among the Na turalists, that all bodies require a
                        succession of time in their motion, which <hi>Light</hi> needs not; But ther
                        is this difference 'twixt the <hi>Imagination</hi> of a human soul and
                            <hi>Light,</hi> that ther besom places wherinto <hi>Light</hi> cannot
                        enter, but ther is no part of the Universe so impervious where the
                            <hi>Imagination</hi> may not make his accesses and recesses at plesure,
                        as appeers by yours while you made that progresse during the time of that

                        backwards, nor the <hi>leggs</hi> downwards; a bloody quarrell fell out
                        'twixt the <hi>heart</hi> and the <hi>liver</hi> which of them received the

                            <hi>spleene</hi> and strange <hi>tympany</hi> of pride lasted, it causd
                        such an ebullition and heat in the masse of <hi>blood,</hi> such a stiffnes

                        spend your breath in vain, and all this while you have said as good as
                        nothing, for I so far detest <hi>human kind,</hi> that, in the mind I am in,

                        that the very devills themselfs abhorr it, then be as I was: Therfore I am
                        resolved never to turn <hi>Man</hi> again, much lesse a <hi>Cherionian,</hi>
                        for, <hi>in statu quo nunc,</hi> I hold him to be not onely the prophanest

                        the same reach and full light of <hi>Reson</hi> as they had when they were

                    <p> I hope now to have met with one fit for my purpose, for I hear her thank
                        Heven that she is come again to the gift of speech: Give me leave to ask
                        you, gentle <hi>Hinde,</hi> how came you to be thus so strangely
                        transfigured? </p>

                    <p> It was the great Queen <hi>Morphandra</hi> who hath put this shape upon me;
                        But, Sir, give me leave to return you a question, Wherfore are you so
                        desirous to know the cause of my transmutation? for I was never ask'd the
                        reson ever since by any, nor had I my speech return'd unto me till now, ever
                        since I went upon four leggs. </p>

                        your infinit advantage, as you shall find, therfore I pray dispence with my
                        curiosity, <pb n="54" facs="tcp:98502:39"/> if I desire to know further what
                        country and condition you were of when you were a <hi>Rational</hi> creture.

                        salacious; There I had my first birth, and was accounted one of the Beauties
                        of my time, till for som dissolut courses and wildnes of youth, it pleased
                            <hi>Morphandra</hi> to give me a second kind of generation, and

                    <p> To be a <hi>Rational</hi> creture is not the thing that I am so averse unto
                        as much as to be a <hi>Woman,</hi> which sex is so much undervalued and
                        vilified by you, that som of your Philosophers (or Foolosophers more
                        properly) have had the faces to affirm that we were not of the same species
                        with men, and if we were, <pb n="55" facs="tcp:98502:39"/> yet it was by an
                        inferiour kind of creation, being made only for multiplication and plesure;
                        Others have given out, that in point of generation <hi>woman</hi> by Natures
                        design is still meant for <hi>man,</hi> and that a female is a thing brought
                        into the world beyond Nature's intention, either by the imperfection of
                        seed, or some other defect; Which absurd opinion how contrary it is to the
                        just order of nature, is manifest to any one that hath but a crum of wit,
                        considering how we also concur to your generation, though som of your old
                        doting Wisards have held the contrary, holding us to be meerly passive in
                        that point. </p>

                    <p> 'Tis tru, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> who was one of the Secretaries that
                        attended Nature's Cabinet-councell doth affirm, that in the female ther is
                        no active principle of generation, but that she is meerly passive, affording
                        onely blood and the place of conception, the plastic formative vertu
                        residing in the <hi>Male</hi> 's feed; But this opinion is exploded by our
                        modern Physitians and Naturalists, who assert that in the female also ther
                        is an active and plastic principle of generation, with a procreative
                        faculty, as appeers in the engendring of a <hi>Mule</hi> which is a mix'd
                        species proceeding from the <hi>Horse</hi> and the <hi>Asse,</hi> whose
                        whole form is made up by the concurrence of both parents, so that the
                            <hi>Horse</hi> alone is not sufficient to produce such a creture, but
                        the <hi>Asse</hi> must co-operat as the efficient cause. </p>

                    <p> You may well add hereunto that the child often times resembleth the mother,
                        therfore she must also be an active principle in the formation; If it be so,
                        what a wrong is it to the justice and rules of nature that <hi>Women</hi>
                        shold be held but little better than <hi>Slaves?</hi> how comes it that they
                        shold be so vilipended and re vil'd? As that foolish <hi>Naturalist</hi> or
                            <hi>Ninny,</hi> who wish'd ther were another way to propagat Mankind
                        than by copulation with Women; Another blurted out, that if men could live
                        without the society of women, Angels wold come down and dwell among them;
                        But <pb n="56" facs="tcp:98502:40"/> that <hi>stinking Cynick</hi> was the
                        worst of all, who passing by a tree where a woman having been abus'd and
                        beaten by her husband, had done her self violently away, he wished <hi>that
                            every tree might bear such blessed fruit.</hi>

                    <p> Such speeches as these proceeded from a kind of raillery or way of jesting,
                        not from the judgment or wishes of the parties that spoke them, and it is
                        commonly seen that they who play upon them with their <hi>wits,</hi> have
                        them most in their <hi>wishes;</hi> For ther is no sober-minded man but doth
                        acknowledg them to be born for our comfort and dearest companions, and to be
                        of equall degree with us in point of creation and excellence, as also
                        capable of the same Beatitude. </p>

                    <speaker>Hinde.</speaker>
                    <p> Ther is good reson to think so, for the Creator took the first woman out of
                        the <hi>midst</hi> of man therby to be his <hi>equall,</hi> and without any
                        ostentation be it spoken she was made of a more refined matter,
                            <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Rib,</hi> which is a purer substance than the
                            <hi>red</hi> slimy earth wherof <hi>Adam</hi> was fram'd; And daily
                        experience tells us, that <hi>We</hi> are composed of purer plasticall
                        ingredients than <hi>You,</hi> because that if a <hi>man,</hi> be he never
                        of so fine a <hi>paste,</hi> wash his hands with the clearest water in
                        severall clean basons never so often, yet he will leave som foulnes and
                        faeculence behind; but a <hi>Woman</hi> can do so and leave the water at
                        last so clear, so fair and limpid, as when it came from the fountain or
                        source it self in few times washing. </p>

                    <p> This Law is enacted for your good, for knowing that you, in regard of your

                    <p> You say very well in that, for unlesse ther be a good houswife at home to

                        that we have not that prudence to manage an estate, and govern it, I pray
                        call to mind the Kingdom of the <hi> Amazons, </hi> how long and how wisely
                        was it governed by women? Look upon that of <hi>Babylonia</hi> which was so
                        much amplified by <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and that of <hi>Scythia</hi> by

                            riona, </hi> who rul'd triumphantly near upon 45 years; And whereas you
                        speak of the want of wisdom that we have, I pray what were the nine
                            <hi>Muses</hi> the Inventrices of all Sciences? what were the three
                            <hi>Graces?</hi> what were the twelve <hi>Sybills?</hi> what are the

                    <p> 'Tis tru that <hi>Minerva</hi> issued out of <hi>Iupiter's</hi> brain, but
                        she had no <hi>woman</hi> to her mother, for so she had not prov'd so wise;
                        And touching the <hi>Muses, Graces,</hi> and <hi>Sybills</hi> you speak of,
                        you know as well that the three <hi>fatall</hi> Sisters, and

                        if you look upon <hi>Heven,</hi> you are but few there, for among the

                    <p> You may as well argue, that because among the twelve Celestiall

                            <hi>brute</hi> Animals, (with two <hi>inanimat</hi> ) that ther are more
                            <hi>brute</hi> Animals in Heven than <hi>Men;</hi> But, Sir, under
                        favour, wheras you alledg that among the Hevenly Planets ther are but two
                            <hi>females,</hi> the rest <hi>males,</hi> it shews that men are of a
                        more erratic and wandring humour than women; Now Sir, touching that
                            <hi>wisdom</hi> you speak of, you have more opportunity to get it by
                        conversing with the world abroad, and so pourchasing <hi>Experience</hi>
                        which is the <hi>mirroir of wisdom;</hi> Wheras we are kept within doores,
                        and shut up 'twixt a few walls, whence you have a saying, <hi>That that
                            woman deserves onely respect and honour, whose actions and praises go
                            not out of the walls of her own house:</hi> And hereunto that you put us
                        to all the drudgery and servile offices at home, while you are joviall and
                        feast it abroad; nor do you onely coop us up so in a kind of prison, but you
                        clap oftentimes a barba rous kind of lock upon us, wheras <hi>you,</hi>
                        though you have <hi>Inclosures</hi> of your own, yet you may go abroad when
                        you list, and, when your lust drives you, feed upon the <hi>Common</hi>
                        without controul; And is not this pure slavery in us, and tyranny in you?

                        when she went she shold carry her house upon her back, that is, she shold
                        make all sure at home; Now to a good houswife, her House shold be as the
                        Sphere to a Star, (I do not mean a <hi>wandring</hi> Starr) wherin she shold
                        twincle with neatnes as a Star in its Orb; And how can you call that a
                        prison wherof you keep the keys, and are commandresses in chief? The <hi>
                            Imperium <pb n="59" facs="tcp:98502:41"/> domesticum </hi> you rule
                        within doors, whither we bring all that we gain abroad, and it is your
                        office to improve and augment it, though many of you are so lavish that you
                        make the poor husband oftentimes to <hi>turn a noble to nine-pence,</hi> as
                        is intimated by that famous picture of <hi>Polygnottus</hi> made of one
                            <hi>Ocnus,</hi> who being a <hi>Cordwayner</hi> by his Trade, as he was
                        making new Ropes, there was a <hi>Wisell</hi> hard by that gnawed off the
                        Cordage, by which was meant his <hi>Wife;</hi> For it is in the wife to
                        husband what the man gets, according to the Poverb, <hi>Ask my wife whether
                            I thrive or no,</hi> for if she be prodigall she will bring her poor
                        husband quickly to <hi>thwitten a mill-post into a pudding-prick.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> Touching the second point, of laying artificiall re straints upon your
                        bodies, it is because som of you can be no further trusted than you are
                        seen; But this ill-favoured custom I confesse is us'd onely in that Country,
                        where women are more hot and lustfull than under other climes, for the
                        Naturalists observe without any partiality, that <hi>your</hi> sex is more
                        salacious than the <hi>Masculine,</hi> wherof ther might be produced a clowd
                        of examples, I will instance onely in two, and they of the highest rank,
                            <hi>viz.</hi> in two <hi>Empresses,</hi> the one a <hi>Roman,</hi> the
                        other a <hi>German;</hi> the first was so cunning in her lust, that she wold
                        take in no passenger into her Barge (for women are <hi>leaking</hi> vesells)
                        untill the Barge was freighted, for fear the resemblance of the child shold
                        discover the tru father, and then she wold take in all commers; The second
                        having buried a most gallant man she had to her husband, her Confessor
                        advised her with ghostly counsell, that for the future she shold live like a
                            <hi>Turtle</hi> during the remnant of her life, because it was
                        impossible to find such an other Mate again among the whole masse of
                        Mankind; Wherto she answered, <hi> Father, since you will have me to lead
                            the life of a Bird, why not of a Sparrow as well as of another Bird?
                        </hi>

                    <p> I shall confront your instances by two other exam ples, as memorable
                        altogether, the first of <hi>Zenebia,</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:98502:42"/> who wold have no carnall copulation with
                        her husband, after she found her self once quick, but wold continue in an
                        admired course of continence all the time of her pregnancy; Moreover the
                        Saint-like Empresse <hi>Bettrice,</hi> who in the verdant spring of her age
                        after <hi>Henry</hi> her husbands death, lived ever after like a
                            <hi>Turtle</hi> as you speak of, by immuring her self in a Monastic
                        Cell, and burying her body alive as it were when he was gone; But what an
                        extraordinary rare example was that of Queen <hi>Artemisia,</hi> who living
                        chast ever after her husband <hi>Mausolus</hi> his death, got his ashes all
                        put in urnes, wherof she wold take down a dramm every morning fasting, and
                        next her heart, saying, That her body was the fittest place to be a
                        Sepulcher to her most dear husband, notwithstanding that she had erected
                        another <hi>outward</hi> Tomb for him, that continues to this day one of the
                        Wonders of the world: Furthermore you know, I believe, better then I, Sir,
                        that at this day in many parts of the Orientall world, such is the rare love
                        of wifes to their dead husbands, that they throw themselfs alive into the
                        Funerall Pile to accompany his body to the other life, though in the flower
                        of their years. </p>

                    <p> It is confessed that many of you have noble spirits, that marvellous rare
                        affections lodge in you, and so you may be deservedly call'd the second part
                        of Mankind, in regard you are so necessary for the propagation thereof, and
                        to peeple the world. </p>

                    <p> Notwithstanding all these indispensible necessities the world hath of women,
                        yet ther is no other species of cretures wherin the female is held to be so
                        much inferiour to the male as we are amongst you, who use to sleight,
                        misprize, and tyrannize over us so much; For ther is one huge race of men, I
                        mean the <hi>

                    <p> The reson of this is, because ther are so many of you either shrews, or
                        light and loose in the hilts, and 'tis a sad case when <hi>Viri fama jacet
                            inter uxoris fempora;</hi> Touching the first, ther's an old proverb,
                        that <hi>Every one knowes how to tame a shrew but he who hath her,</hi> and
                        though ther might be multitude of examples produ ced, yet I will instance
                        but in a few, the first two shall be <hi>Zappora</hi> and <hi>Xantippe,</hi>
                        the one married to <hi>Moyses</hi> a holy man, the other to
                            <hi>Socrates</hi> a great Philosopher, how cross-grain'd the one was,
                        the Sacred Oracles wil tell, and for the other, her husband comming one day
                        in when she was in an ill humour, she scolded him out of doors, and at his
                        going out she whipp'd up into an upper room, and poured down a potfull of
                        piss upon his sconce, which made the poor patient husband shake his head,
                        and break forth into this speech, <hi>I thought that after so much thunder
                            we should have rain.</hi> Another damnable scold having revil'd and
                        curs'd her husband a great while, all which time she had the Devill often in
                        her mouth, to whom she bann'd him, at last he said, Hold thy toung wife, and
                        threaten me no more with the Devil, for I know he will do me no hurt,
                            <hi>because I have married his Kinswoman;</hi> This made the
                        Epigrammatist to sing prettily, <q>
                            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:98502:43"/>

                    <p> I, we use to be the common subject of your drol leries, and you would want
                        matter for your wits to work upon were it not for us; But, touching those
                        humours you pointed at before which are incident to us somtimes, they
                        proceed from the ill usage, and weaknes of the husbands, who know not how to
                        manage a wife, which is one of the prime points of Masculine prudence; We
                        say proverbially, that a <hi>good Iack makes a good Gill,</hi> a discreet
                        husband makes a good wife, though being the weaker vessell, and having no
                        other weapon than her toung she break out somtimes into humors; What a sad
                        thing is it for a woman to have a thing called a husband weaker than her
                        self? how fullsom wold such a fool be? such silly coxcombs as are jealous
                        upon every sleight occasion, and restrain them so barbarously as was spoken
                        before, deserve to wear such branch'd horns, such spilters and trochings on
                        their heads, as that goodly Stagg bears which you see browsing among those

                        and <hi>longer-liv'd:</hi> Touching the <hi>first,</hi> Ther's no creture

                        after keep company with the male for eight months; Concerning the

                        as from the paucity and lazines of the Inhabitants, who are so naturally
                        given to ease and sloth, from cultivating the earth, and doing other parts

                        surpasse; Touching the other part, they are but clinches and passages of

                        the while they finger our <hi>coyn,</hi> for all the world doth grant, <pb
                            n="74" facs="tcp:98502:49"/> that the study of Physic is both
                            <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi> and 'tis the chiefest kind of
                        Learning, for therby a man comes to know himself; For the Physitian can say
                        more truly than any other, <hi xml:lang="la">Nosco meipsum.</hi>

                    <p> Though Physitians know themselfs never so well and the constitution of their
                        bodies, yet when they are sick they commonly take their Receipts by
                        prescription of others, being distrustfull of themselfs; And whereas you
                        say, the practise of Physic is <hi> necessary, </hi> I remember to have
                        read, that the point was debated before Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth,
                        and canvased to and fro, som alledging that Physitians were superfluous and
                        not <hi>necessary</hi> for a Common-wealth, because <hi>Rome</hi> stood and
                        flourished many hundred years before the use of Physic was first introduc'd,
                        during which time men never liv'd more healthfull and longer; His Holines
                        opinion being desired at last, he said, he was for the affirmatif, and that
                        he held <hi>Physicians</hi> to be absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> for a
                        Common-wealth, in regard that <hi>were it not for physicians the world wold
                            be so thick of peeple, that one could not live for another:</hi>
                        Intimating therby that the <hi>Physitians</hi> help to make them away. </p>

                        one of the seven liberall Sciences, consisting of undoubted and certain
                        Principles, containing a world of Naturall knowledg. </p>

                    <p> Ther is <hi>Therapeutic</hi> or contemplative Physic, ther is
                            <hi>Diagnostic</hi> or knowing, and ther is <hi>Prognostic</hi> Physic;
                        If we consider <hi>Physic</hi> as she is a <hi>Seience,</hi> she hath most
                        tru and certain Aphorisms, for she considers onely <hi>Universalls,</hi>
                        which are eternall and invariable, and breed certitudes in us, because she
                        arrives to the knowledg of things by their causes, and so she may be called
                            <hi>Scientificall,</hi> and appertains to contemplation, whose onely
                        scope is to discover <hi>Tnuth</hi> singly of it self; But if we consider
                            <hi>Physic</hi> as an <hi>Art,</hi> which proceeds <pb n="75"
                            facs="tcp:98502:49"/> from experience and action, she is incertain and
                        fallacious in her operations, in regard of the various constitutions of
                        human bodies, for those Drugs and Receipts which do work kindly with som
                        bodies, find crosse operations in others, and many times the tru symptoms of
                        the disease is not known; Moreover we administer to others what we never
                        take our selfs, which made a great aged <hi>Physician,</hi> being asked how
                        he came to live so long, to answer, I have liv'd so long because never any
                        Drug entred into my guts; Besides, when any Pill or Potion hath a kindly
                        operation in the Patient, it is as much by hap as by any good cunning; What
                        a nomber of remedies are ther for one onely disease? whence may be inferred,
                        that ther is not any one peculiar infallible remedy; Insomuch that when the
                        Physitian applies Universalls to Particulars, and administers any Purgation,
                        Vomit, or Electuary, it is requisit that both the Physician and Patient be
                        fortunat, ther is a kind of <hi>happines</hi> required in the busines; Add
                        hereunto, that the complexion of men and women are so diffring, their
                        appetite so irregular and disordinat, that it makes all Physicall operations
                        to be so incertain; Now touching the species of Us <hi>Sensitive</hi>
                        cretures, they are of so even &amp; strong complexions, their appetites are
                        so regular, their nutriments and food, their drinks are so simple, that they
                        need not any physicall Drugs; Wheras among Mankind, they make ever and anon
                        an Apothecary's shop of their bellies, being still in a course of Physic,
                        which makes them so miserable, for it is a tru pro verb, <hi>Qui vivit
                            medicè, vivit miserè;</hi> Therefore a kind of Tragicall speech was that
                        of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> when upon expiring his last, he cried out,
                        be ing but then in the Meridian of his age, <hi>Pereo turbâ Medicorum,</hi>
                        I perish by too many Physitians. </p>

                        than <hi>men;</hi> The Serpent goes to <hi>Fenell</hi> when he would clear

                        find, that Nature hath taught him a remedy against all infirmities that are
                        incident unto him, not onely to the species but to every Individuall, and
                        all this without any expence of time or tresure, without any study or
                        labour, without any fee or reward, without any teaching or instructions from
                        others; Whence 'tis apparent, that Nature is more carefull and indulgent of

                        infirmities more, yet not one in a thousand knowes how to cure himself; but
                        he must have recourse to the Physician, and so trusts him with his life, and
                        if he chance to work a cure upon him, he useth to give his purse a purgation
                        also, for <hi>Though God heals, yet the Physitian carries away the

                        inflammatio, Ranula sub lingua, &amp;c. Go to the <hi>Teeth, Throat,</hi>

                        that are incident to <hi>Women,</hi> ther is Chlorosis or the

                        Proscidentia, with many more; Out of these premises the conclusion follows,
                        that Human bodies both male and female are nought else but frail Vessells,
                        or Bottoms wherin are slowed all manner of perishable Com modities; But
                        these which I have spoken of are corporeall, and most of them outward
                        diseases that attend the <hi>body</hi> of mankind, wherof I have not
                        enumerated the twentieth part; But if you go to his Rationall <hi>Soul,</hi>
                        she hath also her distempers, the indisposition of the inward man is
                        greater, the anxieries and agonies of the mind, the racking torments of the
                        thoughts are more violent, the enchanting passions of love transports him to
                        frenzies. Incertitudes of holy things, and fits of despair work somtimes so
                        powerfully, that he becomes <hi>Felo de se,</hi> making him to destroy
                        himself, and cut off the threed of his life before <hi>Lachesis</hi> hath
                        wound it half up; And were ther a Physician that could cure the
                        discomposures and sicknesses of the human soul, he wold be the rarest among
                        mortalls; And were I sure I could have a faculty to do that, I wold turn
                            <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Physician</hi> again. </p>

                        Ghostly Fathers of the Church, acts and exercises of piety are the lenitifs
                        for such distempers, and preservatifs against them; For he who is in <pb

                        his Creator, is free from such discomposures, from all tumultuary confusions
                        and perturbances of thoughts; 'Tis confess'd, ther's no human creture has
                        his hu mors so evenly pois'd within him, that he is always the same, he is
                        somtimes <hi>Ioviall</hi> and merry, he is somtimes <hi>Saturnin</hi> and
                        melancholy, and it must be so while the Starrs poure different influxes upon
                        us, but especially while the humors within us have a symbolization with the
                        four Elements, who are in restles conflict among themselfs who shall have
                        the mastery, as the humors do in us for predominancy; Insomuch that the
                        humors or passions may be said to be to the soul as strings to a musicall
                        Instrument, which som times use to jarre, sometimes to go in a tru harmony;
                        and this the <hi>Physitian</hi> who is <hi>Natures Student,</hi> hath more

                    <p>Truly Sir I have neither mind nor maw to it, for in the state wherin I am
                        setled, I use to exercise the operations of nature with more freedom, and
                        much lesse encumbrance, following onely the dictats of sense, and being
                        solely guided therby.</p>

                    <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
                    <p> But what are the dictats of sense, compar'd with the intellectuall powers of
                        the human soul? what is the <hi>Sense</hi> which trades alone with grosse
                        bodies, and qualities emergent thence, compar'd with <hi>Reson,</hi> a
                        faculty wherby the soul converseth with blessed An gels and immateriat
                        Beeings, and by Metaphysicall and sublime notions wings her self up into the
                        arms of Him who breath'd her first into the body of man? In the upper Court
                        of the Soul's residence, we may compare the Soul to an Empresse, wisely
                        restraining or giving freedom to the misguided affections, according <pb
                            n="81" facs="tcp:98502:52"/> to the exact rules of Reson; Here we have
                        Man ruling in Man, dressing and manuring Man as another Paradise, wherin is
                        all possible variety, yet no confusion, no disorder, no unruly passions
                        tyran nizing over Reson, no disturbance of mind, no distemper of body, but a
                        most admirable harmony of all things in the whole Universe of Man;
                            <hi>Reson</hi> is that Diadem wherby the soul doth rule and regulat the
                        will, and the affections, the Chancellor which doth moderat the motions of
                        both; <hi>Reson</hi> is that Rod wherwith the Soul is kept in awe to obey,
                        without any servile fear, her Creator and chiefest Good; By <hi>Reson</hi>
                        the Soul discerns ther is a God, deducing arguments from the Creation of the
                        fair fabric of the world, which had either existence from it self, or was
                        pro duced by another; but it could not give a first beeing to it self, in
                        regard 'tis repugnant to the principles of Nature, that any thing should be
                        the cause of it self; Therfore the Inference is undeniable, that the world
                        was made by another which was pre-existent, and such another that was the
                        Efficient cause therof, not produced by any other former efficient cause,
                        but was of Himself, and by Himself from eternity, which can be no other than
                        God; Another argument the Soul drawes from the necessary dependance of a
                        finit Beeing upon an Infinit, for all created natures are finit, both in
                        respect of their essence, and operations; Now, every thing that is finit
                        must necessarily be limited by another, seeing it is impossible that any
                        thing shold give bounds to it self; And ther being not in things finit a
                        progresse to Infinity, We must at length come to some certain Independent
                        Beeing, which is not circumscrib'd or limited by another, but is of it self
                        essentially and virtually infinit, which can be no other than God Almighty;
                        A third argument is drawn from the necessary dependance of a
                            <hi>Secondary</hi> cause upon a <hi>First,</hi> for unlesse we do here
                        also grant a progresse to Infinity, which is absurd in mounting up the scale
                        of subordination of causes, we must at length meet with one primary both
                        Efficient and Finall <pb n="82" facs="tcp:98502:53"/> cause, that hath no
                        other cause superiour or precedent unto it, which is onely God: Another
                        argument the Soul draweth, still by the ministry of <hi>Reson,</hi> to prove
                        a Deity, is the constant cours of the Starrs, those glorious Luminaries, and
                        the continued order of all things else in their first station, through all
                        the vicissitudes of corruption and generation, which doth forcibly intimat
                        an ubiquitary Providence, a wise Rector, Governor, and Commander, upon whose
                        di rection all things depend; No sooner doth the Soul by such reaches of
                        Reson throughly satisfie her self that ther is a God, but she mounts yet
                        higher, endeavouring to know what God is; But such is the transcendent
                        refulgence of his Majesty, that she finds it impossible to look God in the
                        face, or to know him <hi>à priori;</hi> yet though she is not able to behold
                        his face, yet she hath leave granted to know him <hi>à posteriori,</hi>
                        though she cannot <hi>define</hi> the incomprehensible Deity, yet she may
                        still, guided by light of Reson, <hi>describe</hi> him by an aggregation of
                        Attributes? To know God by his Attributes is a near approach to his Deity;
                        Yet the Rationall soul goes still nearer, first prying into his Essence,
                        then returning to her self, and contriving which way she should know more,
                        at length she says within her self, <hi>Operatio sequitur Esse,</hi> Action
                        follows its Being; Then she busies her self in the contemplation of Gods
                            <hi>Actions,</hi> which she finds either <hi>immanent</hi> and inward,
                        or <hi>transient</hi> and outward; The <hi>immanent</hi> actions of God are
                        such as are performed intrinsecally within Himself, without any externall
                        respect to the creture, wherby he is said to contemplat, to know, and love
                        Himself; Here the Soul takes notice of a reflection of the Deity upon it
                        self, and so is heightned to the supposition of a <hi>Trinity,</hi> the
                        cardinall and abstrusest point, the highest pitch she can soar unto; She
                        proceeds to argue, that wheras God doth conceive and know Himself, he doth
                        beget a perfect Image of Himself, from which issueth a perfect Love of
                        Himself, and a complacency; Now, seeing ther is nothing in God which is not
                        God, both the <pb n="83" facs="tcp:98502:53"/> Image of God, and the Love of
                        God seem to be distinct Subsistences of the same Essence with Him from whom
                        they proceed, as when an Eye doth see it self, ther is first the Eye seeing,
                        secondly, the Eye seen, or at least the Image of the eye seen, from which
                        acti on of seeing her arises a desire of enjoyment; This comparison doth in
                        some sort adumbrat the <hi>blessed Trinity;</hi> First, ther is the Eye;
                        Secondly, ther is a Re flection or Image of the Eye; Thirdly, ther is a love
                        or complacency which proceeds from both; The first is God the Father, the
                        Second is God the Son, and the third is God the Holy Ghost; Now, al though
                        these three Subsistencies be all concentred in the Deity, yet they are
                        distinct each one from the other in their operations <hi>ad extra,</hi>
                        though in immanent, or in actions <hi>ad intra,</hi> they are individuall:
                        Thus the Human Soul ascends to the knowledge of her Eternall Good, by the
                        ministry and reaches of <hi>Reson,</hi> therfore me-thinks you should have
                        an Ambition to be endued with that divine Faculty again, and so return to
                        your native soyl from this society of irrationall brute Animals, and be a

                        to his Prince, He is also constant to his Religion, he is in perpetuall
                        enmity with the common enemy of the Crosse, Moreover he never serves any

                    <p> Truly Sir, you may please (as the proverb runs) to keep your breath to cool
                        your pattage, and spend it no longer upon me, for I am resolved to live and
                        die in this shape; But wheras you brand it with the term of
                            <hi>despicable,</hi> I wold have you know, that our bodies have more
                        vertues far in them than <hi>Man</hi> 's, and wherof <hi>Man</hi> makes
                        common use towards his health: Our very <hi>foam</hi> drunk in warm wine is
                        good against pursines; Som of our <hi>hairs</hi> mingled with those of an
                        Asse and dried, and so put to a perfume, are good against the Epilepsie, The
                            <hi>milt</hi> of one of us is good against the Falling-evill, nay the
                        very dust wherin one of us hath tumbled, is good to mitigate the ardors of
                        Love, being sprinkled upon the body; But take heed how you anger us, for our
                        bitings are poysonous: We have sundry other medicinall vertues, which I will
                        here pretermit; Therefore whereas you call this species of ours
                            <hi>despicable,</hi> we deserve rather more re spect considering the
                        said vertues; Insomuch that if I should exchange this shape for man's, I
                        should prove a greater fool than that <hi>Mule</hi> in the Fable, who seeing
                        a goodly barb'd Horse going to the Warrs, and saying within himself, It may
                        be that gallant Horse and I had the same mother, therfore why shold not I
                        have so much courage and stoutnes in me? I wold I had such a rider, such a
                        great saddle, trappings and arms to try my courage; But seeing the Horse led
                        back in the evening all bloody and wounded, he repented himself of his
                        former foolish wish. </p>

                        that I shall not be able to make use of for perfecting my designs upon these

                        the various and violent distempers of the mind, with the stings of

                            <hi>Fox,</hi> who you know is the most politic, the wittiest and wiliest
                        of all Quadrupedalls, wherof ther are multitudes of examples; One time he
                        cosen'd the <hi>Crow,</hi> who having got a morsell of green cheese, and
                        being perch'd upon the bough of an Oak to eat it, a <hi>Fox</hi> perceiving
                        it went under the tree, and stood gazing upon the <hi>Crow,</hi> saying,
                        What a base lying thing is common fame, who saies that thou art a black
                        ill-favour'd Bird? truly methinks thou art the fairest that ever I saw, and
                        couldst thou but sing as others do, thou deserv'st to be Queen of Birds; The
                            <hi>Crow</hi> being tickled with these praises fell a opening her beak,
                        so down fell the cheese, and the <hi>Fox</hi> made merry with it; But he was
                        more wily with the <hi>Wolf,</hi> for a <hi>Fox</hi> having got into a
                        Farmers yard, and skulking up and down in a Moon-shine night, ther being a
                        well in the yard he peep'd into it, and the reflex of the Moon being in the
                        water, he thought it was a new cheese, therupon he whip'd into one of the
                        buckets, and down he went to feed upon it; Being in that plunge, it chanc'd
                        that a <hi>Wolf</hi> came also skulking therabouts for his prey, and loo
                        king into the well, the <hi>Fox</hi> cries out, O brother <hi>Wolf,</hi>
                        her's most dainty cheer, and ther's enough for us both; so the <hi>Wolf</hi>
                        leaping into the other bucket drew up the <hi>Fox,</hi> who being got on the
                        top, and he in the bottom of the well said, Farewell brother <hi>wolf,</hi>
                        and much good may the new cheese do unto you, so he got free, leaving
                        another in his room; He was also too hard for the <hi>Lion,</hi> who as he
                        is King of Quadrupedalls, <pb n="88" facs="tcp:98502:56"/> having put forth
                        a Proclamation, that all horned beasts shold give attendance at Court on

                            <hi>Ass</hi> meeting with a <hi>Fox</hi> said, Come let's go to Court to
                        see the great shew, for if ther shold be any danger we are free from it, in
                        regard we have no horns, though sufficient ears; I, quoth the <hi>Fox,</hi>
                        but if <hi>the Lion saies that our ears be horns, they must be horns;</hi>
                        Moreover I have observ'd the tracks of many beasts going into the Lion's
                        Cave but none comming back: This was onely <hi>caution,</hi> but it was a
                        trick of wit that the <hi>Fox</hi> plaid with the <hi>Eagle,</hi> who having
                        got one of his young Cubbs, and carried it to the top of a high tree where
                        his nest was, to prey upon it, the <hi>Fox</hi> got a brand or two of fire
                        and put it to the trunck of the tree, which so scar'd the <hi>Eagle,</hi>
                        that he brought down the young Cubb and laid it in the place he found it;
                        How commonly doth the <hi>Fox</hi> cosen both Huntsman and Dogg, when being
                        poursued he useth to get into a plowed field, and stretching himself all
                        along in a furrow he often scapes, his skin and the earth being of a colour;
                        Therfore you may make triall now upon a brute Animal that hath some sagacity
                        and wit, as well as activity. </p>

                        of Heven where Meteors and fulgurations are more impetuous and violent. </p>
                    <p> Touching the second, which was my former <hi> Condition, </hi> ther's a
                        thing called <hi>Conscience</hi> which us'd to tyrannize and torture me when
                        I was a <hi>Man,</hi> I often found within me a gnawing worm, I often felt
                        sore stings, sore pricks, and remorses of the said Consci ence, which the
                        Theologues call <hi>Synteresis,</hi> that ever and anon did discompose the
                        quietude of my thoughts, and disturb me in my gaining profession; But in
                        this state I am free from such perplexities, for now, though I suck the
                        blood of twenty Geese a day, and destroy whole roosts of Hens, the thing
                        call'd <hi> Conscience </hi> never troubles me. Moreover, besides this rack
                        of Conscience, ther is a vice call'd <hi>Covetousnes</hi> that <hi>Man</hi>
                        is subject unto, and when all other vices grow old in him, this vice growes
                        younger and younger. I remember I was slavishly addicted hereunto, I would
                        have flayed a louse could I have made benefit of her skin, but now I am free
                        from that fordid vice, from that kind of idolatry, for according to the
                        saying, he is the worse Idolater who adores Gold, for he may be said therby
                        to worship the Devil, for <hi>Pluto</hi> is the god of Riches; In the shape
                        I bear, I covet no more but what wil satisfie nature only: Ther is another
                        cursed and cruciatory humor call'd <hi> Iealousie </hi> which much afflicts
                        Mankind, and it reigns more amongst that Nation I was once of than among any
                        other; Jealousie among the thoughts is like Batts among birds, it doth
                        mightily discompose the whole inward man, and disturb the tranquillity of
                        his mind, nay it hurls him often upon desperat and bloody attempts. </p>

                        Merchants who had been partners a long time, it chanced that one of them
                        knowing the other to be over familiar with his wife, he dissembled his
                        passion a great while, till his thoughts had contriv'd and concluded a
                        revenge upon him, so he solemnly invi ted his partner to a Feast, and after
                        dinner he led him to a Garden that he had by the Sea-side, being there alone
                        together he brought him to an Arbor, where among divers other rarities ther
                        was a curious new large Chari made with such artifice, that when one had put
                        himself to sit in it, ther were certain gins and vices wold suddenly rise up
                        and clasp in his body both arms and thighs; His Partner being thus lockt
                        fast in the Chair, he presently gaggs him, and having lockt the Garden dore,
                        he drew a great double-edg'd knife, and being upon the point of stabbing
                        him, the Partner said, Oh be not so inhuman and barbarously cruell as to
                        kill me before confession, therfore have som commiseration on my soul; Well,
                        replied the murtherer, if thou wilt do one thing, I may spare thee thy life,
                            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:98502:58"/> which is, If thou wilt defie the holy
                        Trinity, and renounce all hopes of salvation in it, &amp;c. The Partner (in
                        hopes of future repentance to expiat his offence) repeated those words three
                        times, and the third time as soon as he had done repeating them, he stabb'd
                        him in the breast, and cleft his heart in two, and so threw his body into
                        the Sea to make food for Hadocks; But a while after his body being retreev'd
                        and taken up in a fisher-net just under that wall, the murther was
                        discover'd, and the murtherer being put upon the Strapado he confessed all,
                        and going up the Gibbe to be executed, he broke out into a great fit of
                        laughter; His ghostly Father and Confessor telling him, that he was now
                        going to give account of that horrid murther he had committed before the

                    <p> Another was as bloody, if not more; In the antient City of <hi>Cerano,</hi>
                        ther was a Prince who left three sons behind him, <hi>Conradus, Caesar,</hi>
                        and <hi>Alexander; Conradus</hi> was us'd to come from his palace in the

                                >Cerano</placeName>,</hi> where he had appointed a Governour, and a
                        Garrison of souldiers; The Governor having a comly Lady to his wife, the
                        young Prince was struck in love with her, and at last enjoyed her; The
                        Governour having knowledge therof did meditat upon a revenge, therupon he
                        sent to <hi>Conradus</hi> (his Lord and Master) that he had lately
                        discover'd two or three wild <hi>Boars</hi> in the Forest of <hi>
                            <placeName type="cypher" subtype="place" ref="#Cerano"
                                >Cerano</placeName>,</hi> therfore if his Highnesse would please to
                        com thither together with his two brothers, ther wold be very Princely sport
                        for them, and he wold prepare all things ready for the Game; Hereupon the
                        young Prince and his second Brother comming thither expresly for that sport,
                        it chanced that <hi>Alexander</hi> the youngest brother was then out of the
                        way; So the Governor <pb n="93" facs="tcp:98502:58"/> of the Castle having
                        provided a plentifull supper for the two Princes and their Retinue, being
                        both gone to bed, he calls his Officers together, and told them, Gentlemen,
                        what does he deserve, who for many good services and hospitalities done unto
                        him, doth in lieu of thanks abuse ones wife, and defiles his bed? They all
                        cried out, He deserves death; Truly Gentlemen, thus hath Prince
                            <hi>Conradus</hi> us'd me; They cried out again, Let him die, and we
                        will stick unto you, and be faithfull; So the Governor taking som of those
                        Officers with him in the dead of night, they broke suddenly into the chamber
                        where <hi>Conradus</hi> was asleep, and heaving up the bed-cloaths, they
                        first cut off his privy-members, then they chop'd off his head, then they
                        quarter'd his body, and strewed them up and down the chamber; So all was
                        hush'd that night; Prince <hi>Caesar</hi> comming to wait on his Brother the
                        next morning, the Governor usher'd him in, and seeing his Brother's head
                        bleeding on the window, and his limbs scatter'd up and down the room, he
                        said, Oh! is this the wild Boar you writ to him of? Yes, said the Governour,
                        and I remember I writ of two or three; Hereupon he was also knock'd down,
                        and us'd in the same manner? The Tragedy being acted thus far, he takes his
                        Officers, and going upon the Castle walls, he sent to speak with the Syndic
                        and Burgesses of the Town, unto whom he made a Speech, that they had been a
                        long time in servitude or a kind of slavery to <hi>Conradus</hi> and that
                        Family, and now ther was a fair opportunity offered for them to redeem their
                        liberties, for he had <hi>Conradus</hi> and his Brother in his custody, and
                        the Officers with the rest of the Garrison were inclin'd to do them away, if
                        the Town wold joyn with them; But the Town shewing an aversnes, or rather a
                        detestation of such disloyalty and treason, sent to Prince
                            <hi>Alexander</hi> the youngest Brother, and the Citizens of <hi>
                            <placeName type="cypher" subtype="place" ref="#Cerano"

                        </hi> joyning with the forces he brought with him to expiat his Brother's
                        bloods, they beleaguer the Castle round; Therupon the Governor taking his
                        wife and children with him <pb n="94" facs="tcp:98502:59"/> to the top of
                        the highest Turret, he first threw down headlong his wife, then his three
                        children, and last of all he precipitates himself, and so the Tragedy ended.

                        divertisment, the Marquis went a Hawking therabouts one day, and letting his

                        after her, and retreeved her in the Orchard where the Marquis himself was
                        entred, having obtain'd leave before; The Hawk being found, the Merchant
                        invites the Marquis to a Treatment, where his wife was present, and very
                        officious to please; Being de parted, she asks her husband who he was? He an

                        and the Marquis poursuing still his design, he at last prevailed, and being
                        admitted to her chamber by a back Garden-dore, he found her a bed, and in a
                        fit posture to receive him; so unbracing himself to go to her, and having
                        put off his doublet, she told him smilingly, Do you know whom you may <pb
                            n="95" facs="tcp:98502:59"/> thank most for this courtesie? It is my

                        high commendations of you, that I never heard him speak so nobly of any: The
                        Marquis being put to a sudden stand hereby, and struck with a kind of
                        astonishment, put on his doublet again and his cloak, saying, Shall I abuse
                        so worthy a friend, and such noble affections? No, I will die first; So
                        taking his leave of the Lady in civill and thankfull posture, he departed

                        Common-wealths to apply them to the present times, wheras those Nations were

                        will find all their opinions <pb n="98" facs="tcp:98502:61"/> concenter in
                        this point, That ther is no Government which hath a nearer analogy with that
                        of Heven, that is more lasting upon earth, that is more regular, or that
                        hath any certain principles, but <hi>Monarchy;</hi> That great Chair-man or
                        Grandee among Philosophers, <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in his Politiques, upon
                        which ther is such a world of Comments, speaks of sundry species of
                        Governments, as <hi>Aristocracy, Democracy, Oligarchy,</hi> and
                            <hi>Stratocracy,</hi> but he puts no Rules for any, onely he hath this
                        assertion, that <hi>Aristocracy</hi> or <hi>Optimacy</hi> allows no <hi>
                            Artificer or Mechanick to be a Cittizen or Counsellor; </hi> Much of his
                        discourse is of the first Founders of Common-wealths, then he proceeds to
                        correct the errors of Common-wealths, before he tells us what a
                        Common-wealth is; Moreover, in handling the kinds of Government in generall,
                        he flies forward and back ward in a disorderly way, but when he descends to
                        particular forms, he is full, not onely of confusion, but contradictions and
                        inconstancies to himself; In som places he seems to deny any naturall
                            <hi>Right,</hi> much more any <hi>Majesty</hi> to be in the
                            <hi>People,</hi> whom <hi>he holds to be little inferiour to
                            Beasts;</hi> Wheras else-where he af fordeth a liberty to every City to
                        set up what Government they please, either by Force or Craft, which in
                        effect is to allow the Peeple to do what they list, if they be able. Now
                        this high-reaching Philosopher cannot much be censured for roving up and
                        down in so incertain a subject, it being impossible for any hu man brain to
                        prescribe any infallible universall Rules for Government, that may quadrat
                        with the nature of all Climes and Seasons, and be appliable to the humors of
                        all Peeple; Other Sciences have Demonstrations, and undeniable Principles,
                        but the Art of Government hath no such Maxims, in regard of a thousand sort
                        of contingencies that attend human negotiations, as also for the various
                        dispositions of peeple, som Nations are so fiery mouth'd, that they must be
                        ridd with a Bitt, if not with a Curb and Martingale, but a small Bridle will
                        serve others, nor are the same Constitutions fit for a <hi>Continent</hi>
                        that are proper <pb n="99" facs="tcp:98502:61"/> for an <hi>Iland,</hi> nor

                    <p> Touching those modern Smatterers in Policy you speak of, the times abound
                        with such, such that while they take upon them to give Precepts for
                        Government, they amuse the Reader with Universalls, (and commonly ther is
                        deceit in Universalls) or ra ther they lead him to a labyrinth of
                        distinctions, wherby they render the Art of mastring Man to be more
                        difficult and distracted, then it is in its own nature; But, under favour,
                        the main cause that ther are such difficulties and incertitudes in
                        prescribing gene rall Rules to govern the Human Creture, is the perturbances
                        of his mind, his variety of humors, his seditious disposition, his
                        inconstancies, and an itching still after innovations; And herein we
                            <hi>Irrationall</hi> Animals are more obedient, more gentle and docile;
                        But touching the policy you mention, ther be som certain Maxims that may
                        extend to the whole masse of Mankind in point of Government; One is, That
                        the common peeple be kept still in such an awe, that they may not have any
                        power to rise up in Arms, or be sharers in the Government, and so be their
                        own Caterers to chuse what Laws they please; Secondly, That ther be a
                        visible standing effectif military strength still in being, to keep them in
                        such an awe, as well to <hi>curb</hi> them as to <hi>conserve</hi> them; It
                        being the greatest Soloecism that can be in Government to rely meerly upon
                        the affections of the <hi>Peeple,</hi> in regard there is not such a
                        wavering windy thing, not such an humorsom crosse-grain'd Animal as the
                        common Peeple, ther is not such a Tyrant in the world if once he get on
                        Horse-back; And all Authors that have pretended any thing to policy, either
                        old or new, affirm so much in their Writings; If the Governour in chief hath
                        not such a constant visible Power, and moveable upon all occasions, the
                        common Peeple will use him as the Froggs in the Fable us'd the Logg of wood
                            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:98502:62"/> whom <hi>Iupiter,</hi> at their
                        importunity, had dropt down among them for their King, to whom they stood a
                        while in som awe and dread, but afterwards finding no motion in him, they
                        leapt and skipt upon him in contempt and derision; There is another certain
                        principle of policy, That public Traitors and Rebells to their Prince and
                        Country shold be dispatched to the other world without mercy, for if they be
                        but half punished, they will like Snakes get and cling together again,
                        therfore 'tis a good rule, and that may be a proverb hereafter, <q>
                            <l>A Rebell and mad Dogg knock in the head,</l>

                    <p> Madame, I shall most willingly comply with your commands herein; Touching
                        the Sympatheticall Powder or Medicine it self, It is made of a <ref
                            type="editorial" target="#zaphyrian">Zaphyrian azurd salt</ref>, calcind
                        by <ref type="editorial" target="#solar_fire"><hi>Solar</hi> fire</ref> into
                        a <ref type="editorial" target="#lunar_complexion"><hi>Lunar</hi>
                            complexion</ref>, operating principally when the Sun is in the two
                        celestiall Signes of <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Cancer;</hi> But, Madame, before I
                        can make the thing truly understood, I must lay down som universall Laws or
                        Maxims of nature; First, it is tru without controul, that all actions and
                        motions are performed by <ref type="editorial" target="#atoms">Atoms</ref>
                        or small invisible bodies, moving to and fro after a different manner
                        proportionable to their severall figures, all naturall things operat thus,
                        and not by I know not what Qualities or Accidents, which have onely a
                        notionall subsistence, and no reall being but as they inhaere in the
                        substance; Secondly, ther is a perpetuall constant expiration of such
                            <hi>Atoms</hi> from all naturall bodies, caus'd by a compression of
                        other <ref type="editorial" target="#circumambient">circumambient</ref> and
                        neighbouring bodies, driving the parts closer to gether, or else by the
                        motion of other <hi>Atoms</hi> crowding into the <ref type="editorial"
                            target="#foraminous">foraminous</ref> parts of that body, interrupting
                        as it were the quietude of the former inmates, and thrusting them out to
                        wander in the air till they meet with som other body where they may get
                        rest; This <ref type="editorial" target="#effluvium">effluvium</ref> or
                        emanation of <hi>Atoms</hi> by help of <ref type="editorial"
                            target="#autopticall_glasses">autopticall Glasses</ref>, have bin
                        sensibly discerned to flow from the Load-stone and other bodies, whose pores
                        are more plentifull, in form of a kind of mist; In bodies that are actually
                        hot this atomicall expiration is sensibly perceptible by the smell,
                        specially to cretures of an acuter sense, for the Atoms hovering in the
                        circumambient air, or upon the ground, are sure guides to the Grey-hound
                        while he poursues the Chace, as if the hunted creture were continually in
                        his sight; These expiring Atoms are also as sensibly discover'd by weight,
                        it being experimentally found, that those <hi><ref type="editorial"
                                target="#Iockies">Iockies</ref></hi> who use to run Horse-races can
                        make them selfs lighter by many pounds weight in a day or two, <pb n="104"
                            facs="tcp:98502:64"/> which proceeds by this insensible emission of
                        Atoms; Secondly, it is to be observ'd, that these atomicall bodies are not
                        of one figure, nor of one grossnesse or magnitude, som being so slender and
                        subtle that they admit of no opposition, but continu their course through
                        all Mediums, and whatever may be seen to stop them in their journey cannot
                        be discerned but by their effects, such are the contagious Atoms of bodies
                        infected with the Pest, or other taking-diseases, which are not onely
                        imparted to others by lurking in the Visitant's cloths, but being scattered
                        in the air are transported to remote places and persons, on whom they
                        exercise their tyranny, not discover'd till they break out into open
                        violence; Other Atoms are grosser, and cannot so easily passe by, but are
                        driven back, and forced from their intended voyage, and somtimes driven into
                        the pory parts of other bodies against their wills; Such Atoms are
                        apprehended by our senses, as heat, cold, color, smells, putrefactions,
                        &amp;c. which use to move more slowly than others; Som are so corpulent and
                        strong that they remove fix'd and solid bodies out of their stations, as the
                            <hi>Wind,</hi> and many others, that are driven to and fro by the
                        impetuosity therof, and forced therby to change their places; These Atoms
                        are in a manner so palpable, that we must needs confesse their reall Beeing
                        and activity; Thirdly, it is another undeniable truth, that all bodies
                        desire rest, and wold still dwell in their own proper stations if they were
                        not ejected by an intruder, for <hi>Rest</hi> is the appetite of all
                        naturall bodies, because 'tis the mother of union; Now, ther are som places
                        more fit than others for the receiving and retaining of the said Atoms,
                        wherin they may lodg more conveniently, and acquiesce a longer time, this
                        proceeds from the fashion and form of the pores wherin they are <ref
                            type="editorial" target="#intromitted">intromitted</ref>, which are
                        proportionable and more agreeing with the figures of the Atoms which are of
                        divers shapes, for som are angular, som cylindricall, som are branch'd, som
                        smooth, others are sharp and rough; Ther are in most bodies <pb n="105"
                            facs="tcp:98502:64"/> pores agreeable to these various figures, insomuch
                        that every naturall body is apt and ready to admit such Atoms that are
                        cognate and proportionable to their pores, and to exclude others; Now no
                        Atoms acquiesce anywhere but in such proportionat pores, they may be driven
                        into other bodies, or they may accompany other Atoms into pores that do not
                        exactly quadrat with their figures, but cannot take any long repose there,
                        being still extruded by those that do better fill the place, and correspond
                        with the capacity and proportion of those pores, whence ariseth a naturall
                        propension and tendency towards those bodies where such pores are found; Nor
                        can those Atoms which are not sutable to the pores wherein they are, stay
                        there quietly, but they are still dislodg'd and sholder'd out, or pressed to
                        give room to those Atoms whose figures challenge a right to those pores;
                        Insomuch that it may be said, ther is a kind of perpetuall warr 'twixt those
                        Atoms that are proportionat and proper to the pores they are lodg'd in, and
                        those which usurp them; For to have perfect rest in a place, and to claim a
                        naturall right unto it, ther must be a <ref type="editorial"
                            target="#cognation">cognation</ref> 'twixt the atom and the pore which
                        may be call'd <hi>Sympathy,</hi> such as are all magneticall and attractive
                        motions; Fourthly, no distance hinders the motion of these Atoms towards
                        their naturall cognate places, towards which they are perpetually
                        travelling, and the nearer they approach to their desired home, the swifter
                        their motion is, and the lesse resistance they find in their journey. </p>

                    <p> Noble Prince, these are high Philosophicall Notions that you discourse of,
                        but now that you have spoken of the substance of this rare Medicament, how
                        must it be apply'd? </p>
                </sp>
                <sp>
                    <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
                    <p> The manner of applying it is in this manner, The blood or bloody matter
                        being taken from the wound on a cloth, or remaining still on the wounding
                        instrument, must be lightly covered over with this powder, kept very dry,
                        and afterwards wrapp'd up close from the air, and so preserved in a temperat
                        heat, it must also be kept clean, and clos'd up with neat linnen to fence it
                        from cold, for cold hinders the expiration and breathing forth of the <ref
                            type="editorial" target="#balsamicall">balsamicall</ref> Atoms, which
                        shold drain forth the superfluous humidity, and restrain the efflux of
                        blood; Now, the greatest rarenes of this <hi>Sympatheticall Powder</hi> is,
                        that by a <hi><ref type="editorial" target="#virtual_contact">virtuall
                                contact</ref></hi> it heals at a distance by the intercourse of the
                        Atoms proceeding from the extravenated blood of the Patient, which <ref

                        entrance at the cognate parts, and proportionat pores of the wound; Being
                        admitted there they fall to work, and first, they dilate the superfluous
                        humid parts, and make them fit to be expell'd, then by their more then
                        ordinary restrictive power they shrinck together the pores, and squeezing
                        out that noxious corrupt humidity, glew together the disunited <pb n="107"
                            facs="tcp:98502:65"/> parts, and so <ref type="editorial"

                        produce diverse pregnant examples of those that were healed by the atomicall
                        energy of this Sympatheticall powder, but I desire one may serve for all;
                        Ther was <ref type="editorial" target="#knowing_captain">a knowing
                            Captain</ref> who made often use of it, and two of his Officers having
                        drawn blood one of another in a Duell, he got their bloodied Swords and
                        applied his balsamicall Powder, so in lesse then 24 hours they were almost
                        cur'd; But the Captain understanding that their animosities were such, that
                        they were resolved to fight again, he hung the balsam'd bloodied Swords out
                        at his window all night, so comming the next morning to visit his Patients,
                        they told him that they were in cruell pain all night long; And so you shall
                        be still, quoth the Captain, untill you be perfect friends, for I hear that
                        you will fight again; So having made them shake hands, and perfectly
                        reconcil'd them, he cur'd both in a very short time. </p>

                        to have read of the <hi>Wolf</hi> in the Fable, who finding a young Lamb,
                        and intending to devour him, fell a coining of reasons why he would do it,
                        and so told him, that he and his generation had don him wrong from time to
                        time: Helas, said the <hi>Lamb,</hi> how could that be? for I am but newly
                        com into the world; I but, quoth the <hi>Wolf,</hi> you eat up my grasse;
                        The <hi>Lamb</hi> replyed, How can that be, Sir? for I have yet no teeth in
                        my head; I but you drink up my water, quoth the <hi>Wolf</hi> again; That
                        cannot be neither, Sir, said the <hi>Lamb,</hi> for I never knew what water
                        is hitherto, in regard I feed altogether up on my mothers milk; 'Tis not
                        your reasons, replied the <hi>Wolf</hi> again, can confute my appetit, for I
                        mean to sup plentifully this night, and so devour'd him. But the same fate

                        him, as if he had bin their King; He thinking to enlarge his Dominions,
                        thought to go to the Sea to be King there, but meeting with the
                            <hi>Dolphin</hi> in his way he was presently devour'd; Or as

                        better, for I have now no airy aspiring desires in me, no ambitious

                        this shape of body to be far more healthfull, nor is this species lesse
                        honourable; A <hi>Wolf</hi> was the Crest of the first Arms of
                            <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard the King who trac'd the foundation of that
                        glorious City, and denominated her after his own name, was nurs'd up
                        miraculously by a <hi>Wolf;</hi> Ther have bin many famous men of that name,
                        as <hi>Lupus Fulvius</hi> a Roman Poet, <hi>Lupus Servatus</hi> a memorable
                        Priest, and <hi>Lupus de Oliveto</hi> a Saint-like Monk; Ther is a kind of
                        Holines also in this species, for they never engender but in the twelve days
                        of <hi> Christmas; </hi> Ther is likewise a mysterious quality in this
                        species; for if a <hi>Wolf</hi> sees a man first, the man grows hoarse; If
                        the tail of a <hi>Wolf</hi> be hung in the Cratch of Oxen, they cannot eat;
                        If a Horse treads in the foot-steps of a <hi>Wolf,</hi> he cleaves fast as
                        if he were frozen; Nay, if a Mare big with Foal tread in the place where a
                            <hi>Wolf</hi> had trodden, it causeth abortion, and will make her
                        presently to cast her Foal; Lastly, strings made of <hi>VVolfs</hi> guts
                        have that predominance in Music, that if they be put among other strings,
                        ther wil never be any Consort. </p>

                        'twixt what is noxious or profitable for us, we have also the same organs,
                        the same cells and receptacles in the brain as man hath for to lodg Reson,
                        and the celestiall bodies pour the same influences upon us as they use to do

                        life, to find out food and shelter, and bring up their young ones, its onely
                        direct Reson that's capable of <hi>Singulars,</hi> its restrain'd to an
                        opinionative faculty, its a meer shadow of ours, much like the objects that
                        our fancy represents to us in sleep; And this Instinct in Beasts is as much
                        inferiour to Reson in Man, as Reson in man is inferiour to Intelligence and

                    <p> Yet, Sir, it must be granted, that actions whose suc cesses are so well
                        ordered, actions which have so well regulated a progresse, and concatenation
                        so exactly tying the Mediums to the End, must needs be performed by the
                        guidance and light of tru Reson, and such actions you know sensitive
                        cretures daily per form; With what art do Birds build their nests, the Fox
                        his hole, the Badger his chamber, with what cau tion do they preserve their
                        young ones, and fence them from the injury of the Hevens? how punctually do
                        they keep their haunts? But what do you think of <hi>Pliny</hi> 's Elephant
                        repeating his Lesson at Moon-shine, or of <hi>Ptolomey</hi> 's Stagg that
                        understood Greek, of <hi> Plutarch </hi> 's Dogg who could counterfeit the
                        very convulsions of death, of the Ape that could play at Chesse, and another
                        that had learnt som touches on the Guittern? What think you of
                            <hi>Caligula</hi> 's Horse who was made Consul? had not he Reson in him?
                        What think you of the Asse, who being us'd to carry burdens of Salt over a
                        Foord was us'd to stumble and fall constantly in such a place, that therby
                        the salt melting away into water his burden might be the lighter, but his
                        Master lading him with a tadd of Wool, he fell at his usuall place, but
                        being helped up again, and he feeling the pack of wool heavier in regard of
                        the water that got in, he never stumbled any more in the Foord after that
                        time; What think you of the Crow, that in the time of a great drowth finding
                        water in the bottom of a barrell, and being fearfull to go down, carried so
                        many stones in her beak, that letting them fall down, they forc'd the water
                        to rise upwards towards the top, and so she dranck safely and at ease? I
                        pray were not all these not onely Instin ctive but <hi>Discoursive</hi>
                        Resons? </p>

                    <p> I confesse that he who denies a kind of <hi>Reson</hi> and Resoning also to
                        brute Animals, may be questiond whether he be master of Reson himself, yet
                        this <hi>Reson</hi> and Resoning looks upon present and particular notions
                            <pb n="120" facs="tcp:98502:72"/> onely; But human Reson extendeth to
                        universall notions out of the reach of sense, which cannot be without
                        abstractions, and som reflections it hath on it self, which Beasts cannot
                        attain; This Reson that is conversant with Universalls is the tru
                        specificall difference 'twixt Man and Beasts; It is the portion and property
                        of Man alone, whereby he hath the Soverainty over all over his
                        fellow-cretures throughout all the Elementary World; Ther is
                            <hi>Intuitive,</hi> ther is <hi>Discoursive,</hi> and ther is
                            <hi>Instinctive</hi> Reson, the first is proper to <hi>Angels,</hi> the
                        last to <hi>Brute</hi> Animals, and the second to <hi>Man,</hi> who can
                        contemplat and discourse of generalls and things absent; And these three
                        differ in excellency as the three degrees of Comparison. </p>

                    <p> Yet though you excell us as you say in this kind of <hi>Reson,</hi> thers
                        many of us that surpasse you in strength and quicknesse of sense, as the
                            <hi>Eagle</hi> in seeing, for he can look upon the Sun in the Meridian
                        with full open eyes, and not be dazzled; the <hi>Hare</hi> can hear better,
                        and the <hi>Dogg</hi> goes far beyond you in smelling, as also the
                            <hi>Stagg,</hi> therefore when he is removed from one Park to another,
                        you use to muzzle him, and carry him in close Carts that he may not smell
                        the way back again; And there be examples to admiration of this kind. </p>

                    <p> Though som Beasts smelling be beyond ours in re spect of celerity, and way
                        of reception, yet in point of dijudication, &amp; differencing the variety
                        of smels which proceeds from the Rationall Soul, we surpasse them; Therfore
                        though we cannot see as <hi>Eagles,</hi> nor hear as <hi>Hares,</hi> nor
                        smel as well as <hi>Doggs,</hi> yet Hands, Speech, and Reson makes amends
                        for all; The composition also of the body being <hi>Erect</hi> is
                        advantagious, the caus of which Erection (after the beholding of Heven) is
                        the exercise Arts, which cannot be done in another figure; Mans body is
                        likewise the most copious of organs, and though born naked, yet this
                        nakednesse cuts out work for Reson; It abounds also more with Animal spirits
                            <pb n="121" facs="tcp:98502:72"/> and heat, it hath long feet that the
                        body might be more steedy, and his head is built upward like a Castle or
                        Watch-tower in the upper Region. </p>

                    <p> This faculty of discoursive <hi>Reson</hi> you glory of, that Man is endued
                        withall, though in som respects it be a benefit unto him, and given as a
                        recompence for his frailties, nakedness and weakness, yet in som kind it it
                        may be said to be a disadvantage unto him, for it makes him subject to a
                        thousand vexations of spirit, it fills him with inquisitive thoughts and
                        scruples touching his salvation, it makes him a tyrant to himself by sundry
                        sorts of perplexities and molestations of mind, for I have known it by
                        experience, let the threed of a man's life be never so well spun, yet it
                        cannot be without bracks and thrumbs: Ther is no creture so troublesome to
                        himself as man, for as rust adheres naturally to Copper, so ill affections
                        and obliquities adhere to human nature: Moreover, <hi>you,</hi> like us, are
                        but raggs of mortality, yet you are so vain in magnifying your own species,
                        that you make Man the epitome and complement of all created natures; Nay,
                        som have prophanely affirmed, that if all the Angells in Heven had bin a
                        thousand years a forming man, they could not have made him in greater
                        perfection, and yet when I seriously oftentimes did contemplat Man, and fell
                        into a tru account of his imbecillities, and that world of weaknesses which
                        use to attend his body and mind, I have often cryed out, <hi>Eheu nos miseri
                            quàm totus Homuncio nil est!</hi> What nomberles diseases is his frail
                        body, which is the socket of his soul, subject unto? how short are his
                        plesures, and what black sudds commonly they leave behind them? insomuch
                        that they may be said to have wings and stings, for sadnes succeeds his joys
                        as punctually as night follows the day. </p>

                    <p> It may well be said to be so, for of late years ther were cull'd out within

                        our bodies be judg; 'Tis known by daily experience how our blood hath such
                        an energy in it that it can dissolve Diamonds, it also scowreth iron better
                        then any file, and being fryed and drunck with wine it cures the bloodyflix;
                        The Load-stone rub'd with Garlick loseth its attractive vertu, but being
                        dipt in Goats milk it recovers: Ther's no creture hears more perfectly then
                        a Goat, for he hath not onely Ears, but an Acousticon Organ also in the
                        throat: Our hair burnt driveth away Serpents, and cureth decayed genitalls;
                        The marrow of a Goat is singular good against Aches; The gall mixed with
                        hony good to clear and fortifie the sight; The very trindles drunck in wine
                        are good against the Jaundise, and to stay Female-fluxes, as also gargariz'd
                        good against old coughs; The fatt sodden with Goats dung is good if applied
                        to the Gout; The butter of the fatt of a male Goat is good for an old sore
                        for Kibes, the Kings-Evill, and Fellons, or mixed with hony or oyl of
                        Brambles 'tis good against deafnes; The gall makes white hair grow on a
                        horse; Goats milk is excellent against Consumptions, and you know how the
                        famous <hi>Aegistus</hi> was nurs'd by that milk. To conclude, ther's
                        nothing within us or without us but it is cordiall or medicinall; Our

                        Metaphysicall, why he wold not turn Man again, alledging at last that the

                        that they did but ask and have any thing; He gave amongst them those antient
                        Demeans that went to maintain the <hi>Mitre</hi> so many hundred years by
                        the pious donation of Progenitors; He conferr'd honors abundantly upon them
                        of all kinds, and did other wondrous acts of grace, for which the great

                    <p> Truly; Madame, I may say, that all this while according to the old proverb,
                        I have bin <hi>shooing of Goslings </hi>I have spent my labor and breath to
                        little purpose in order to my main designe, yet I cannot deny but that I

                        transform'd thing, none of all the rest did brand his own Country-men so
                        bitterly: He lays to their charge originally all those fearfull calamities,
                        those horrid confusions, those cataracts of blood which fell of late years
                        both in <hi>

                        purchased therby, is, to have foold themselves into a perfect slavery, and
                        to have brought themselfs under an <hi>Iron Rod</hi> in lieu of that
                            <hi>Golden Scepter</hi> under which they liv'd formerly. </p>

                        that the winds blow fair I must think of a departure, and touching those
                        most Princely civilities, &amp; sublime inexpressible favours you have bin

                        ring out <hi>Morphandra</hi>'s glory wheresoever I passe; Nay I will procure
                        your most rare and transcendent vertues, which are beyond the power of
                        mortalls, to be engraven with indelible characters of the most burnish'd

                    <p> Most accomplish'd and heroick Prince, those civilities and treatments you
                        have received here were due unto you by the common Laws of Hositality, and
                        you might therby have claim'd them as a Right; But truly I shold be very
                        well contented if you were made partaker of your so laudable desires, as to
                        have som of these metamorphos'd Animals re-transmuted, that so you might
                        carry with you som <hi>reall</hi> returns of your Voyage; Therfore you may
                        please to try one conclusion more, and I spy a fit subject for you to work
                        upon, in yonder great hollow Oak you shall meet with a Swarm of
                            <hi>Bees,</hi> who have built up their Cells there, wherof I will
                        capacitat som with a perfect faculty of Reson and Ratiocination to
                        interweave discourse with you; They were formerly a Cloyster of

                        spontaneous free choice, they undertook that austere, yet pious and
                        plentifull train of life, yet they fell a murmuring and a humming at the
                        solitude and hardships of that holy Profession, and to think too <pb n="134"

                        are, therfore you may please to make towards them, and you cannot tell what

                        advantage; I understand by Queen <hi>Morphandra</hi> that you were once
                            <hi>Intellectuall</hi> Cretures, and the children of Reson; nay, you
                        were a degree above ordinary human happines, being in a contemplative and
                        sweet sacred cours of life, wherin you had secluded your selfs from the
                        world with the vanities therof, and espoused your selfs to your Creator, by
                        keeping the perpetuall pure fire of Virginity. </p>

                    <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
                    <p> 'Tis tru, we kept that ceremonious outward fire, but within us we felt too
                        often such flamings, such furnaces or <hi>Mongibells</hi> of fires, such
                        violent affections and impetuous desires, that made us half mad for the
                        time, the sense of our restraint making these fires far more raging and
                        vehement, for though in externall appeerance and habits, we shew'd som
                        symptoms of mortification, yet we could never extinguish the sparks of the
                            <hi>concupiscible</hi> appetite, which is so naturally inherent in every
                        body. </p>

                    <speaker>Pererius.</speaker>
                    <p> I thought that by performance of so many penances, by your temperat diet, by
                        your abstemious use and choice of meats, by your so frequent fastings, by
                        your hard lodgings having matts for your beds, and stones for your pillows,
                        by your early risings, by being always employ'd in somthing or other to
                        avoid idlenes, which is the Devills couch; I say, by the practise of these
                        austerities, I thought you had quench'd those concupiscentiall flames. </p>

                    <p> The operations of nature can hardly be quite suppress'd, but their motions
                        are irresistible; nor are these naturall motions given by the Creator to our
                        sex to be a torment unto us, but for delight, and being lawfully and
                        moderatly us'd, they are destinated for the propagation of Mankind: Moreover
                        ther is a saying, <hi> who fights against Nature fights against God himself,
                            she being his Hand-maid. </hi>

                    <p> I cannot deny but that <hi xml:lang="la"> Naturam sequi, est Deo obseque,
                        </hi> to follow Nature is to obey God, yet as our gretest <hi>prudence</hi>
                        is seen in the <hi>conduct</hi> of our naturall passions, so our gretest
                            <hi>prowesse</hi> is seen in the <hi>conquest</hi> of them, when they
                        grow exorbitant and rebellious; We need not seek for enemies abroad to
                        exercise our valour upon, we have too too many within dores, we have enough
                        of domestic and inmate enemies to cope withall. </p>

                    <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
                    <p> And will you have us to put on that nature again? But, Sir, besides what we
                        spoke of before, ther was another thing that did torture us in that
                            <hi>Monastic</hi> life, it was the apprehension of our captivity, being
                        sequester'd and cut off as it were from the society of Mankind, &amp; in a
                        manner from the <hi>Living,</hi> 'twixt whom and us (in that state) ther was
                        this difference, that they were to die before buriall, but we were buried
                        before death; Now, ther is nothing so tedious to all natures as
                        imprisonment, which we shew'd when we slept in the bosom of our Causes in
                        our mothers wombs, whence we broke out to get liberty, and to be a
                            <hi>Nun</hi> is as it were to go into a kind of womb again. </p>

                        earth, you were as so many <hi>fixed</hi> Starrs which being the higher are
                        more noble, and nearer the throne of the Almighty, than the <hi> Planets,
                        </hi> which wandring up and down never keep the same distance betwixt them.

                    <speaker>Bee.</speaker>
                    <p> Sir, under favor, we are not of that opinion; For you know the <hi>Sun</hi>
                        and the <hi>Moon</hi> are called the <hi>Great Luminaries</hi> in Heven,
                        therfore they must be the more noble, specially the <hi>Sun,</hi> wherin God
                        himself is said to have his <hi>habitation,</hi> or Imperiall Throne, whence
                        he sees the motion of the Universe, and over-looks all his cretures
                        throughout the world; Now, these noble Erratic Starrs are in a perpetuall
                        progresse, which the <hi>Moon</hi> finisheth in twenty nine daies,
                            <hi>Mercury</hi> in four-score, <hi>Venus</hi> nine months, the
                            <hi>Sun</hi> in a year, <hi>Mars</hi> in two, <hi>Iupiter</hi> in

                    <p> The <hi>fixed</hi> Starrs have also a motion within their own Orbs, and the
                            <hi>Convent</hi> wherein you were before might be called a
                            <hi>Constellation of fixed Starrs,</hi> which I say do move within the
                        circumference of their own Spheres, as you did within the walls of your
                        Monastery amongst your selfs. </p>

                    <p> But by the condition wherin we are now stated, we may be said to have a
                        larger <hi>Beeing,</hi> for we have turn'd our <hi>Convent</hi> to a
                            <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> or rather our <hi> Monastery </hi> to a
                            <hi>Monarchy,</hi> wherin we have as exact an oeconomy, and politicall
                        rules of Government, as ever we had in our <hi>Monastery;</hi> We have a
                        Souvrain King, who although he hath no sting as all the rest have, yet he
                        carrieth such a Majesty that makes us all exactly obedient to his commands;
                        Nor, though he bear no arms himself, was ther ever heard of any
                            <hi>Rebellion</hi> amongst us against our lawfull Prince, as is so
                        frequent amongst Mankind; It being a principle from the very instinct of
                        nature amongst us, that it is both detestable and damnable for Subjects to
                        rise up against their supream Governour, and go about to right themselfs by
                        Arms; I say, that in this state we have a very regular Government, we have a
                        King, we have privy Counsellors, we have Commanders in the War, and
                        gregarian Soldiers; We keep close in Winter, and have then our Centinells;
                        We go not abroad till <pb n="137" facs="tcp:98502:80"/> Beans do blossom,
                        and then, if the weather permit, ther's never a day passeth in idlenesse; We
                        first build our Cells and Combs, then make Hony, and then engender; We make
                        our Wax and Hony of the freshest and most fragrant flowers, and abhor
                        withered or stinking vegetalls; When the flowers are spent in one place, we
                        have our harbingers abroad to find out another; being surprised by night in
                        our expeditions, we sleep in a supine posture with our bellies upward, to
                        preserve our wings from the falling dew; Betimes in the morning we are
                        awakned by our Drummer, who punctually performs his office that way; Then,
                        if the day be mild, we fally forth in a great body, and we have an instinct
                        to foresee winds, tempests, and rain, which makes us keep often within; When
                        we go abroad to work, every one hath his task, and the younger are put to
                        the hardest, while the elder labour within dores; We all feed together, and
                        if we be surprised abroad with a sudden wind, we take up a stone 'twixt our
                        feet to give weight to our bodies, that they may not be blown away; Ther is
                        among us a Censor of manners, and som Officers that watch those which are
                        slothfull, who are afterwards pu nish'd with death, and for the
                            <hi>Drones,</hi> which are a spurious kind of brood, we quite banish
                        them; Ther's not the least foulnes seen in our Alvearies or Hives, for we
                        abhor all immundicities and sordidnes; When 'tis towards night, our hummings
                        lessen by degrees, till an Officer fly about and command silence and sleep,
                        which is instantly done; We first build houses for our Workmen and Plebeans,
                        and then palaces for the Nobles and the King; We punish sloth without mercy;
                        we faithfully obey our King, being always about him like a guard, and He in
                        the midst; When the peeple are at work, He goes about and cherisheth them,
                        He onely being exempt from labour; He hath always his Officers ready to
                        punish Delinquents; When He goes forth, the whole Swarm attends him, if He
                        chance to be weary, we bear him upon our sholders; Whersoever He rests,
                        there the generall Randevous <pb n="138" facs="tcp:98502:81"/> is; Wasps,
                        Hornets, and Swallows are enemies to us; We bury our dead with great
                        solemnity; At the Kings death ther is a generall mourning and fasting, with
                        a cessation from labour, and we use to go about his body with a sad murmur
                        for many daies; When we are sick we have attendants appointed us, and the
                        symptoms when we be sick are infallible, according to <ref type="editorial"

                        two Souls, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>vegetal</hi> and the <hi>Sensitive</hi>)
                        propagated and traduc'd by the seed and sperm of the parents, and that this
                        was done by the hereditary vertu of that gran universall Benediction,
                        pronounced by God himself to all his cretures, <quote type="#scripture">

                        of the parents, she wold be perishable with the <hi>Body,</hi> wheras she is

                    <p> I remember the reply to this, That the excellency of the <hi>human</hi> Soul
                        is not to be derived from her creation and first materialls, but from the
                            <hi xml:lang="la">Fiat,</hi> or eternall Decree, and particular blessing
                        of the Creator, who endowed her from the beginning with such a prerogative,
                        out of his free will and plesure, to be capable of eternity: But wheras you
                        aver, that the parentall feeds are too grosse ingredients to produce so
                        noble a Soul, I remember ther are great modern Doctors and Physitians who
                        hold, that neither the seed of mother or father go to the impregnation, but
                        that the Female conceives onely by a virtuall contact, as the Loadstone
                        draws Iron, and that she is made pregnant by conceiving the generall
                            <hi>Idaea</hi> without matter; To make this new assertion good, they
                        compare the womb to the brain, and that what the phantasma or appetit is in
                        the brain, the same phantasma or its analogy is excited in the womb, for
                        both of them are call'd <hi>Conceptions.</hi>

                    <p> I remember another argument that was urged for the <hi>traducible</hi>
                        generation of the human Soul, which was, that the <hi>Rationall</hi> Soul
                        begins to operat in the prolificall seed the very first moment of concepion,
                        as soon as the prolificall emissions of both sexes are blended by mutuall
                        fermentation, for then the conformative and proper operations of the
                            <hi>Rational</hi> Soul begin upon the Embryo, who proceeds to majoration
                            <pb n="142" facs="tcp:98502:83"/> and augmentation accordingly; And it
                        is no lesse then an absurdity to think, that the Infant after conception
                        shold be majorated by the influence of any other <hi>Soul</hi> then that
                        from whom he received his <hi>formation;</hi> Now, that this formation
                        begins instantly after the <hi>conception,</hi> appeers by the early
                        activity of nature, which hath bin sensibly discover'd in abortive Embryo's
                        by autopicall observations, wherby it hath bin visibly found, that a
                        Septenary Slip put into clear water, a subtle Inspector through a magnifying
                        Glasse may discern all the rudiments of the organicall parts; Ther may be
                        seen there the generall conformative faculty in the seed, wherin will
                        visibly appeer three small bubling conglobations, which are the materialls
                        of the noblest parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Brain,</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi>
                        and the <hi>Liver;</hi> ther will appeer also two small black Orbs, or
                        atomicall points, which are the rudiments of the <hi>Eyes:</hi> Whence may
                        be strongly inferred, that if organization, and the conformation of the
                        Infant begins in the very punctillio or first moment of the conception, that
                        the <hi>Rationall</hi> Soul <hi>then</hi> works in the seed, as being the
                        most vigorous part of it; From hence it follows, that <hi>Man</hi> doth
                        absolutely procreat <hi>Man,</hi> which could not be if the Genitor did not
                        communicat the <hi>Human</hi> Soul unto his Issue; For since <hi>Man</hi> is
                        compos'd of Soul and Body, if the parent cannot cannot impart both to his
                        ofspring, he may be said to be inferiour to Beasts, who have intrinsic
                        active principles, and power in themselfs to propagat, and beget <hi

                        done her that right, as is evident in their works; Moreover, the
                        Intellectuall <hi>Human</hi> Soul doth prove her self to be immortall, both
                        by her <hi>desires,</hi> her <hi>apprehensions,</hi> and her

                        infinit we know, and never satisfied in this world; Now, it is a

                            ther is no naturall passion given to any finit creture to be

                        eternall Truths, which are her chiefest employments, and most adaequat
                        objects, declare her <hi>Immortall;</hi> Thirdly, from her
                            <hi>operations,</hi> 'tis known, that all <hi>corruption</hi> comes from

                        her <hi>state</hi> and <hi>operations</hi> pronounce her <hi>immortall,</hi>
                        which operations she doth exercise without the ministery of corporeall
                        organs, for they were us'd to be a clog to her; Add hereunto, that she useth
                        to spiritualize <hi> materiall </hi> things in the Intellect, to abstract
                        Idaeas from Individualls; She can apprehend <hi>negations</hi> and <hi>

                        actings conclude her <hi>immateriality,</hi> and as 'twas pointed at before,

                        ther's no <hi>corruption</hi> ther's no <hi>mortality;</hi> Now, her prime
                        operations being without the ministery of <hi>Matter,</hi> she may be
                        concluded <hi>immortall</hi> by that common principle, <hi>

                        she can be made <hi>neither,</hi> it follows, that she can never lose the
                            <hi>Beeing</hi> she hath; Besides, since the egress out of the body doth
                        not alter her <hi>nature,</hi> but onely her <hi>condition,</hi> it must be
                        granted, that she was of the same nature while she continued
                            <hi>incorporated,</hi> though in that kind of imprisonment she was
                        subject to be forg'd as it were by the hammer of <hi>materiall</hi> objects
                        beating upon her, yet so, as she was still of her self what she was;
                        Therefore when she goes out of the passible ore wherein she suffer'd, by
                        reson of the foulnes and impurity of that ore, she immediately becomes
                        impassible, and a fix'd subject of her own nature, <hi>viz.</hi> a
                            <hi>simple pure Beeing;</hi> Both which (as hath it) may be illustrated
                        in some mesure by what we find passeth in the coppilling of a fixed metall,
                        which as long as any lead or drosse or any allay remains with it, continueth
                        still melting, flowing, and in motion under the muffle; but as soon as they
                        are parted from it, and that 'tis become pure, defaecated, without mixture,
                        and single of it self, it contracts it self to a narrower room, and
                        instantly ceaseth from all motion, it grows hard, permanent, and resistent
                        to all force of fire, admitting no change or diminution in its substance by
                        any externall violence; In like manner it may be said, when the
                            <hi>Rational</hi> Soul departs from the drossy ore of the Body, and
                        comes to be her <hi>single self,</hi> she is like ex alted Gold, and reduc'd
                        to the utmost perfection; She can be no more liable to any diminution, to
                        action or passion, or any kind of alteration, but continues fix'd for ever
                        in the full fruition of unconceivable blisse and glory. </p>

                    <p> Excellent Prince, these are high abstracted notions, transcending the reach
                        of vulgar capacities; But you were pleased to reflect somwhat upon the
                        blisfulnes and joys of the <hi>human</hi> Soul in the other world, I pray be

                    <p> These joys, as they are beyond <hi>expression,</hi> so they are beyond all
                            <hi>imagination;</hi> That vast <hi>Ocean</hi> of Felicity which the
                            <hi>separat Soul</hi> is capable to receive cannot flow into her, untill
                        those <hi>banks</hi> of earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi> corporeall </hi> walls
                        of flesh be removed; Those infinit joys which the <hi>human Soul</hi> shall
                        be ravish'd withall in Heven are unmeasurable, and beyond any mathematicall
                        reaches; They have length without points, breadth without lines, depth
                        without surface; They are even and uninterrupted joys, but to go about to
                        expresse them in their perfection were the same task, as to go about to
                        measure the Ocean in Cockle-shells, or com pute the nomber of the sands with
                        peeble stones; Touching these faint and fading plesures among the
                            <hi>Elements,</hi> we use to desire them when we <hi>need</hi> them, and
                        when we have them, the <hi>desire</hi> presently languisheth in the
                            <hi>fruition;</hi> Moreover, we use to love earthly things most when we
                        want them, and lesse when we have them; The daintiest meats and drinks
                        nauseat after fulness; Carnall delights cause sadnes after the enjoyment;
                        All plesures breed not onely a satiety but a disgust, and the contentment
                        terminats with the act: 'Tis otherwise with Celestiall things, they are most
                        lov'd when they are enjoy'd, and most coveted when they are had; They are
                        always full of what is desir'd, and the desire still lasteth, but it is a
                        co-ordinat desire of complacency and continuance, not an appetit after more,
                        because they are perfect of them selfs; Yet ther is still a Desire, and a
                        Satiety, but the one finds no want, nor can the other breed a surfet; The
                        higher the plesure is, the more full and intense is the fruition, and the
                        oftner 'tis repeted the more the appetit encreaseth; Whence this conclusion
                        follows, that ther can be no proportion at all betwixt the joys of a
                            <hi>separat Soul,</hi> and those of a <hi>Soul embodyed;</hi> For the
                        least dram of the spirituall joyes in Heven is more than the whole Ocean of
                        fleshly contentments; One drop of those abstracted, those pure, permanent;

                        that can be imagin'd, for your flexanimous and hevenly perswasions, which we
                        found so melting and sweet, that we may justly think <hi>Bees</hi> sat upon
                        your lips, as they did upon <hi>Plato</hi>'s, in your cradle, or that you

            'carine,' meaning the keel of a boat. Howell added the word to Thomas Blount's 1656
            dictionary <hi>Glossographia</hi> and may have been intent on getting it into common
            use. It is now obsolete.</note>
        <note type="editorial" resp="#AZ" xml:id="sciolist">From the latin 'sciolus,' meaning a
            person, usually an editor, of superficial knowledge; a pretender to knowledge. Used with
            some irony here, as Thomas Blount's preface to Glossographia (To Reader,sig. A4)
